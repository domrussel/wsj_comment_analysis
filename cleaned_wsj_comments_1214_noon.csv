Jill Sollitto,Would you write this article if Dr Jill was a male? Would you tell first gentleman the same advice?
Allen McCoy,"This piece takes aim at everyone with a doctorate in anything but medicine.  The author sounds bitter, and perhaps regrets that he did not do the grunt work, and jump through the hoops needed to get his credentials the traditional way. So, I understand he may feel too much a fraud to wear the mantle himself, having only earned an honorary doctorate through years of service.  But don't speak for the rest of us."
Bob Fesmire,"So, is Mr. Epstein complaining about the decline in the prestige of honorary doctorates, the loss of rigor in advanced education, or is he just offering some friendly (""kiddo?"") to the new First Lady? Seems like the latter was just for the headline, which apparently did its job--nearly 4k comments--but the rest is one long whine. Mr. Epstein's piece could serve to illustrate the decline in seriousness and relevance of WSJ op-eds."
John Walsh,Who are you to call anyone kiddo?  A doctorate is a great acomplishment and she should used the title Dr.  She earned it.  
tom Walsh,How many science and math  classes and foreign languages did she take for that prestigious Phd in education? 
Howard Zitsman,"The WSJ would be a better, more trustworthy publication without any editorials or opinion pieces.  Allowing Kiddo Epstein to use the WSJ brings into question the judgement and integrity of everything contained in the WSJ.  Stick to business, industry and economic reporting and stop damaging your reputation and credibility.  It will catch up with you.  It's your reputation, stupid."
Kenneth Salchow,"Mr. Epstein doesn't betray a misogynistic bias by using the term ""kiddo"".  Although it is inappropriate to refer to someone you don't know by a familial name, Dr. Biden, EdD is a public figure and it comes with the territory.  He is within his rights to be rude and petty.No, the phrase that most belies the sexist slant is "" I note you acquired your Ed.D. as recently as 15 years ago at age 55, or long after the terror had departed"" (emphasis added).  When and at what age she acquired her degree is irrelevant; stating ""long after the terror had departed"" to somehow add some sort of legitimacy to the argument is not only sexist (and flagrantly so), it also shows a lack of knowledge of human biology (""long after""??).   Had Mr. Epstein simply refrained from such, his main point might have had more constructive discussion.  Had he actually completed, and defended, a dissertation, he might have learned such.  As it is, he created click-bait; period. "
STEVE DUNNING,"In ""Sleepless in Seattle"", there is this relevant exchange: Jonah to his dad: ""Talk to her, dad, she's a doctor"".  Dad (played by Tom Hanks) responds: ""Of what?  Her first name could be doctor"".  IMHO, the movie quote was intended as a silly & humorous jab at what one scriptwriter perceived as pretension.  This WSJ op-ed (that has so far garnered over 4K letters) maybe should be viewed in the same light.  I applaud Paul Gigot's Commentary in today's WSJ standing up for Professor Epstein. "
Craig Midgett,"I gotta hand it to him, Mr., would hate to mistakenly refer to him as Dr., Epstein checked all the ""Get Off My Lawn"" boxes. Things were harder in my day, check. Hard knocks, in absentia because of having to report, for duty reference, check. That degree is not REALLY worthy of the title, check. And, finally, the creme de la creme, forget having your own identity and be a good wife...<chef's kiss> marvelous, CHECK.This is the kind of hornets' nest kicking letter any editorial page would dream of, and the WSJ was lucky enough to get...and even got to make their defensive stance for not backing down from the ""politically correct cancel culture"". Talk about knowing where your bread is buttered. Thanks for the red meat, WSJ. Now if I could only hear myself think over all these soap boxes and crosses being dragged around, the noise is deafening."
Bohai Harvest,"Even if the ""Dr"" title is legit, I still think Melania is smarter because she speaks several languages.   "
Kevin Kershisnik,Melania can't string an English sentence together to safe her life.  
William Young,"Mr. Epstein -- Joey -- dude, congratulations on  a mean-spirited  pointless  screed. Welcome to the conga-line of mediocrity that is the WSJ opinion pages!"
Jack Gerber,"This piece is so mind-numbingly dumb, I can not believe the WSJ wasted the ink to print it.I love the WSJ's business coverage but the Opinion pieces are so outdated and slanted, they are eroding the credibility of the paper as a whole.Unfortunately, I am cancelling my subscription and finding my business coverage elsewhere."
D K Stewart,"Dear Mr. Epstein,Why so ungenerous so late in life?Sue SheridanChevy Chase, MD"
Alan Gotlieb,"This article was written to undermine an individual who has every right to be referred to as Dr.  Mr E displays the personality of an individual who could not endure the rigors of following a path to a PhD.  Instead he pretends he was an academic by referring to teaching at a major university when in fact he was a lecturer with the least of credentials needed to teach maybe a single course at the college level.  His honorary doctorate degree is given to recognize a person's achievements on the societal level.  It is not a sign of his academic achievement.  Dr. Biden has earned her designation through years of study and now her achievement as a scholar and research professor. She is highly qualified to teach and perform research to uncover the mysteries within our education process. Just as the captain of a ship is called captain, the leadership of an educator at the highest level deserves the designation doctor.   
Dr. Alan G, Professor Emeritus, Former Dept Chair, Plant Pathologist"
Manuel Rodriguez,"This is a misogynistic hit piece disguised as social satire to appease the anti-Biden crowd. But the truth is the WSJ business leadership will love the eyeballs, nationwide, poring over this thing. It worked. "
Anne Pickrell,"The most appalling aspect of this article is that the WSJ actually printed it.  Given Mr. Epstein's lack of credentials and his history of writing anti-feminist, anti-homosexual articles, he really should be banned.  For shame, WSJ"
David Sims,"Dear Mr. Gigot,I see in the NYT this: ""Why go to such lengths to highlight a single op-ed on a relatively minor issue?"" wrote Mr. Gigot, who elsewhere said the responses reflected ""what was clearly a political strategy.""I'm not sure you understand.  This is not political so much as personal.  Women have been mistreated, ignored, demeaned, and belittled for thousands of years.  It is only in the past century or so that women could reach the level of achievement represented by a doctoral degree, having previously been kept down by men.To denigrate even one woman's accomplishment has struck a nerve, a very deep nerve, in women all across the country.  It has also struck a very deep nerve in men like me, who appreciate women's talents, accomplishments, and contributions to the world.This isn't some Democratic Party organized response.  This is one opinion piece, written by a man with imposter syndrome and a big chip on his shoulder, that's insulted at least 50% of the country."
Laura Bess,"Bravo, Mr. Epstein, you found a way to write an article about yourself (no one cares) as you attempted to take down the accomplishments of Dr. Biden, our new First Lady who we do care about. What's your actual point? That a woman claiming her doctorate requires more than acquiring a doctorate? That the First Lady needs to know her place and back off from titles? That you want a revamping of the whole system and only doctors in hospitals should be called doctors? I don't get it. The only thing I got from this is that you aren't feeling good about yourself. Shame on WSJ for humoring you."
Michael Wisniewski,Wow.  Talk about stroking your own ego. Mr. Epstein basically spouted off his entire resume while bashing on Dr. Biden.  I have no problem with Dr. Biden using her proper title.  And I have an MD.  Maybe Mr. Epstein should go back to school and get the degree which he so obviously desires.
Phebe Intihar,"I didn't realize Jill Biden is one of those fake doctors. PhDs calling themselves doctors cause so much confusion --- people think they actually ARE doctors, when they aren't and can't prescribe, and all that has to be sorted out. These types are pretentious, trying to get social credit they don't deserve. "
Nathan Moore,This opinion does not deserve to be published in the WSJ.
Jesse Esparza,"She's not a doctor, she earned a doctorate, but it doesn't make her a doctor. She shouldn't use Dr. in front of her name period, it's pretentious and undeserved. "
Sagar Wadgaonkar,Melania Trump should not have received an Einstein visa when her only achievement was being a stripper. Its pretentious and undeserved. 
david breneman,This issue is important enough to warrant space in the Weekend Journal?  
Andrew Colin,Everything about this family is fraudulent. 
Sagar Wadgaonkar,"Ya it was terrible when the Bidens established a fake university to swindle Americans out of their hard-earned money. Wait, sorry that was the Trumps."
David Sims,"Also terrible when the Bidens stole money from their own charity set up, or so they said, to collect money for kids with cancer.Hold it...that was also Trump and his family...not Biden...TRUMP."
Rex Gillit,"""Kiddo""?! I recently subscribed to WSJ and and am stunned to find myself already regretting that decision after reading this. I understand the importance of offering a broad range of perspectives, but I struggle to find even a sentence in this piece that conveys reason or merit. This is pure misogyny wearing the flimsiest disguise."
Romnee Clark,I also just recently subscribed to WSJ and have buyer's regret already. I will just stick to the business news until the subscription ends.
stuart watson,"Call me by my name, without the honorific ""Bachelor,"" which is what I am, albeit ""of Science,"" a lesser creature than if I were ""of Arts,"" which required mastery of a language other than the one to which I was born.  Pig Latin was not an option during my years at the University of Oregon (Quack! Quack!) While we're at it, why do we refer in correspondence to members of the U.S. Senate as ""honorable,"" when by much recent behavior, they are far from deserving? In the case of Mrs. Biden., out of respect, how should we address her other than ""Hey, Jill?"""
Andrew Colin,Another non subscriber weighing in... sigh. 
Oscar Uribe,Gate keeping much Andrew? Sigh
Bridget Krause,Dr...the same that peter navorro referred to himself as because of his doctor in economics.    
Siddhartha Kumar,"Accurate and to the point. As a recent Ph.D graduate in Chemistry  I can attest to the fact that we were always encouraged to call our research advisors by their first names.  Even in professional conferences peers holding a Ph.D rarely addressed each other as doctors,  even medical doctors rarely introduce themselves as doctors unless specifically asked for their occupation.It seems to me politicians trying to prove their smarts are the only ones trying to impose their honorific titles in todays informal and friendly work environment."
Sagar Wadgaonkar,Jill Biden isn't a politician. She simply happens to be married to one. Am I a doctor simply because my wife is one? And did you consider Melania Trump to be a politician? 
Sagar Wadgaonkar,I find it deeply ironic that the author had no issues with First Lady Melania Trump having a career as a stripper but deems it necessary to belittle First Lady Jill Biden for having a PhD and an esteemed career in education. You have forfeited your journalistic integrity and revealed yourself to be a partisan hack. This is beneath the Wall Street Journal.
NORATED NEVIUS,Projection?
Sagar Wadgaonkar,"Not at all. I find Melania Trump's career as a stripper an embarrassment to the office of the Presidency, while I find Jill Biden's career choice a worthy achievement. That isn't a partisan statement. That is simply my opinion on the relative merits of these two first ladies (for the record I deeply admired Laura Bush, Barbara Bush, and Nancy Reagan). "
tom Walsh,your Hate of a beautiful educated woman that speaks 5 languages is so sad and pathetic. Dr Biden speaks no foreign languages and was banging Joe Biden when she was married. She was a hosebag
Bridget Krause,"good point.    Melanie stayed with trump after he began banging a porn star, shortly after the birth of his son.   My guess is she stayed because of the money.  Which makes her a prostitute.   "
Merritt Robertson,This from Dr. Joseph Epstein?
Eric S Ludwig,"He said he had no PhD. Thus, he would be Professor Epstein. "
Julia Moore,"Professor is a specific title for tenure-line faculty. As a BA, who was an adjunct lecturer, he would be addressed as Mr. Epstein, not professor."
Wiley Wright,"A Ed. D. is a bogus degree serving only to move one up the overly structured education stovepipe.  Better to stop awarding all degrees in Education and to require subject matter expertise.  Our children are receiving little benefit from our failing education system, and we are paying enormous amounts of tax dollars for a poor product. "
Thomas Hayes,"Um...Haven't I seen an article or two about ""Dr.""Phil in this paper over the years? He holds a doctorate in Philosophy."
Christine A. Shustak,"The thing I find most interesting is that anytime you criticize any member of a politically correct, protected class, it's automatically racism, sexism, homophobia, or any host of other isms or phobias.  It's never just criticism, completely devoid of any other inclinations.  If you criticize, you always have nefarious intent.It's why BLM, You Too, and the rest are so dangerous.  They cloak their Marxist efforts in some PC cloak, so if you ever say one negative word about them, you're attacked, cancelled, and purged.Civil rights for minorities is indeed a valuable goal.  I support blacks, women, LGBT people, and any other oppressed group.  I do not support the nefarious organizations that have co-opted their messages to push their dangerous, dogmas."
NORATED NEVIUS,Exactly.
James Weichel,"I cannot believe the Editorial Staff thought this opinion deserved to be published.  To say only MDs can use the Dr. title is total nonsense.  There are a million PhDs in the country, and any of them can use the Dr. title.  The only reason Jill Biden is related to this is that she is not a medical doctor.  To use her in the headline and article is pure clickbait.  As a long time reader of the WSJ, I believe the Editorial leadership has lost all semblance of reasonable accuracy and now seldom read the section."
Keith Altomare,"Is this really the question we need the country to think about?  C'mon, let's get the country back communicating before we discuss silly questions like this.  "
Carolyn Kost,"On the one hand, this is an issue that affects women disproportionately; while males with PhDs are called Dr., women are more often called Ms.  See ""That's Dr. So-and-So to You"" (CHE,9/10/ 12).  In some countries, there is an obsession with titles and the bearer of an academic doctoral degree is referred to as Professor Doctor to differentiate from medical doctors. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, the U.S. publication that tracks all news about higher education, all university faculty are referred to as Mr. or Ms. (and the occasional Mx. on request from those who demand attention to their idiosyncrasies), regardless of whether they hold a PhD or other degree.  ""We find ""Mr."" and ""Ms."" more egalitarian for our audience.""  Egalitarian. Hmmm. Isn't that supposed to be what the Dems favor? More likely,  ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" "
Tad Schell,"The comments here are enlightening. Democrats who were willing to say anything about Donald and Melania are now whinging because Joe and Jill are are the target of similar comments.  Democrats can dish it out, but they sure can't take it.   I can't wait for democrats to bring up ""healing the nation"" again. "
Beth Radtke,"Oh come on, had a democratic first lady had nude photos, the right would have lost their shizzle. Melania was criticized for her actions, yet that was pretty much skated over.  Claiming a woman who earned a doctorate shouldn't use her title because she hasn't delivered a baby is ridiculous by any measure. That's criticizing her for accomplishments, accomplishments that apparently are too much for the author to handle or not be made to feel inferior."
Lloyd Thompson,"Good morning,  I am particularly offended by Mr. Epstein's misogynist, paternalist editorial criticizing Dr. Jill Biiden's use of HER title ""Dr."".   I am also disappointed that you would print something of this ilk.
I have always admired your factual down the middle reporting, however this rant by a clearly threatened male is as offensive as that by Tom Cotton published in the NYT in June demanding massive military-style force be used against Social Justice demonstrators.A review of your screening processes and guidelines for op-eds appears necessary.Lloyd Thompson"
Stephen Parsons,"The truth is that most people don't like Joe Biden, his wife, his grown kids, or anyone else in his clan. The only one I have any feeling for is the illegitimate granddaughter over in Arkansas. "
Beth Radtke,"Oh, if only 80 million people disagreed with this. Oh yeah, they did."
Kent Smith,"""Like"" is not a necessary condition when deciding a vote Ms. Radtke."
Sagar Wadgaonkar,Is that why the majority of American voters voted for President Biden?
beryl rosenstein,"I think an apology is in order to the more than 120,000 osteopathic physicians in the United States who could serve as the White House Physician, and especially to Dr. Sean Conley, D.O., a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine who has served at President Trump's personal White House Physician since March 2018.

Brittney Brescia,This is a disgusting and embarrassing piece regardless of your political persuasion. I am a daily WSJ reader and am reconsidering my subscription.
Christine A. Shustak,"It's an opinion.  You can read the newspaper, and disagree with the opinion, and move on."
Andrew Colin,She wants to cancel this paper. That is her point. When things are said that she doesn't agree with then they are bad. 
BURTON ROSEMAN,"I would like to add to the ""not worthy to be a doctor list"" .....Barbara Ferrar , the Public Health officer  who is the woman in charge of locking down California...........and my Aunt Adinawho wanted to be called Dr.Marsha Roseman"
Victoria Compton,"Ok, boomer.Almar LaTour, in case you wonder why you're losing so many subscribers under the age of 60:  This is why.  "
RIchard Martinson,"Dr. Biden earned her right to use the honorarium as she sees fit.  I finished my doctorate in my 60's (not in education) and understand firsthand the effort and challenges involved in reaching that milestone as an ""older student"".    I applaud Dr. Biden's use of the title.  Good for her!  Certainly nice to have educated people in the administration again after four years of amazing ignorance under Trump."
Beth Radtke,"Sadly, that's the thing. Anyone who works to better themselves academically is seen as ""elite"". Remember when people were inspired by smart people, rather than having to lash out for being made to feel inferior? "
Sandra Etherton,The publication of this opinion is the final straw.I'm voting with my dollars and cancelling my WSJ subscription today.
Michael Aiello,"Does everyone realize that this is the same guy that wrote:""I would wish homosexuality off the face of the earth""and that his sons could do nothing to make him sadder than ""if any of them were to become homosexual.""Don't worry, he'll be dead soon and forgotten along with the rest of his ilk. But please, feign outrage when we call them ""deplorable."""
john gury,He can be somewhat forgiven for having been an undergrad at the UofC where students are formally told as part of freshman indoctrination that the title Dr  is reserved for medical doctors - since the groveling tendency is to call all professors Dr.   Otherwise this is absurd and witless trolling snark.  
Kurt Heidelberg,"Just because you can be a jerk doesn't mean you should be.  Did someone hurt your feelings when you were a lecturer, Joseph?"
Don Snyder,"Are you kidding me?  An attack on a female that has a doctorate?  Why not on all of the men that use the title ""Doctor"".  The WSJ said that they will always post controversial topics.  What a joke.  I think they meant, any topic that is anti female.  The WSJ should have supported ANYONE that uses the term ""Doctor"" when they earn  their Doctorate. But instead this was an attack on the wife of the soon to be President. I never see any opinion pieces against Melania Trump.Biased? Yep?I always  liked the WSJ until now.  "
John Beghin,"The Germans use ""Professor Doktor"" which is even more silly than adding a PhD after one's name on a business card or calling oneself Dr.  or Professor. The only time I use Dr or Prof.  is when I have a medical appointment and the MD takes himself seriously with ""Hi I am Dr so & so , to which I reply Hi I am  Professor B."" which surprises them. Else let's keep these titles for our CVs or when credentials are requested.A note on EdD degrees: These are typically not the hardest to get and often derided by other fields on many campuses as not equivalent to PhDs. "
Victoria Compton,"Ok, boomer."
Beth Radtke,"So why are you threatened by people using the title they worked for and earned? If one works hard, they have every right to use it and should be proud. What other people deride in order to make themselves feel better shouldn't be of any consequence."
John Beghin,No threatened at all. Be my guest and use the earned credentials as you see fit. No harm intended. No worries. I can find another way to define my self-worth and have a sense of accomplishment. 
Mary Walsh,"Poor WSJ....so small and narrow-thinking, and so subtly trying to bash the Bidens.  This is why I cancelled my subscription and was offered two months free for you  to ""try again. "" As a Writing Instructor, not Doctor,  (but would be proud to say so if i were), I teach considering the reader. Evidently your readers may like this sorry insult, but I don't.  Get a little respect."
Stephen Creamer,"Please ensure that all of the proceeds from my subscription stay with the news section, because this drivel deserves a refund/cancellation. 3K+ Americans are dying every day because the incumbent administration wouldn't listen to doctors, medical or otherwise.  cover that."
Andrew Colin,Ah the COVID death toll is being brought up. Shame Mrs Biden isn't a real doctor to do something about it. 
Joe Toran,What a shameful drivel!  WSJ editors should apologize for this article.  I am embarrassed for them.  
Ji Mao,"The mental gymnastic some are willing to go through just to nitpicking something out of nothing. Obama eating a hotdog with muster, wearing a brown suit, now  Jill Biden's title.  If this is not the behavior of sore losers, then i don't know what is."
Ellen Gehrs,"Back my interviewer days, I would ask applicants if they remember their SAT scores.I knew Mensa accepted those as proxies for an IQ test, the score in which I (and the US military) consider highly relevant to one's potential.(So says my father.)"
J Alexander Bodkin,"I admire Joseph Epstein, and try never to miss his interesting and engaging contributions to the Journal.  But he was punching below the belt this time. It is no easy feat to earn a doctorate, whether in medicine (my profession), or in philosophy, theoretical physics, ancient history, clinical psychology, music theory, educational theory, or any other established, respected area of academic inquiry.  As Mr. Epstein correctly notes, the doctoral degree has been cheapened at its periphery by its sale to university donors, and being awarded to admired public figures and ""experts"" in made-up socially ""woke"" areas of scholarship that have no history and very little future.  But anyone who makes it all the way through to doctoral degree through hard work in an authentic area of scholarship has earned the title Doctor, and has every right to use it as they see fit. "
John Harris,"... needed to be said ....A GREAT article, Joseph Epstein !!"
Don Snyder,"Why?  This was not directed at everyone that uses the term ""Doctor"".  This was used as an attack on a female.  This was not a generalized comment."
Matthew Trulio,"Partisan politics are one thing, Mr. Epstein, but this is just silly. My ex-wife has a doctorate in counseling psychology and a state license in the profession. My father has a doctorate in chemistry to go along with his master's degree in physics. Neither is a medical doctor, both use the title in their professional worlds, which is standard practice. Get over yourself, kiddo."
Vin Hoo,How about Dr Atlas? Was he deserving of his title?
Christine A. Shustak,Can you imagine if Trump got a Ph.D and lorded it over his constituents?   The left would have imploded.  
Robert Findlay,"We all know that wouldn't happen, unless of course he was able to extort, steal, or cheat his way to  a fake accomplishment. He has yet to earn anything of legtimate accomplishment in his entire pathetic life. "
JAMES RICE,"Why would the left implode if Trump legitimately earned a Ph.D?  It would have been accepted and acknowledged.  Unlike Trump,  most other people have some capacity to respect others actual accomplishments."
STEPHEN SMITH,"Mr., Ms, Mrs., Sir, and Ma'am ... only terms I will use.You can keep your ""Dr"", Pastor, Father, Mr. President, Senator, etc. title.  Your degree or profession matter very little as to your quality as a person."
Robert Findlay,"""quality as a person""? Can you please share what that might mean with reagard to Dr. Biden, and while you are at it,  share some details of the what you consider the ""quality  as a person"" might be regarding Donald Trump. .....""quality"" is not a term legitamatley in use when it comes to Trump."
Beth Radtke,"By all means, yes, don't show respect to people for their hard work. Says far more about you then it does about them. "
William Gaines,"I love it. Any criticism of a woman or minority is sexist, racist, etc, etc....but....only if it suits the liberal narrative. Criticize Melania, Ivanka, Collins, etc all day, for example, and that is par for the course. Just like when Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by a woman who was the only person on earth who could even put them in a room together and he was the devil. Then when Biden is accused by someone he was definitely in the same room with it was ""we believe Biden"".  Continue with the repugnant hypocrisy and ""cancel culture"", and you will continue to repel me and many others from voting for anyone in your party no matter how bad the candidate on the other side of the bill is."
Beth Radtke,"You wouldn't vote Democratic anyway. You can't see that by him telling her to not use her title, a title that she earned, is sexist? Can you see this ever being leveled at a man? "
Andrew Colin,Can you see this ever being leveled at a man? Where were you over past 4 years? This is tame compared to what was hurled at the other side. 
SUSAN HARRIS,"Finally, someone had the guts to  write what I've been thinking.  I assumed Dr. Biden was a medical doctor until shortly before the election.  Another attempt by the media and powers to be to mislead the public.  Her Ph.D. Is real but she's no medical doctor and I'd bet millions of Americans think she is."
Beth Radtke,"So because you don't understand that a doctorate doesn't always mean a medical doctor, that her degree is misleading? Tell that to the other million doctorate degree holders out there. Sorry, Ms. Harris doesn't comprehend that you can't help her with her sciatica, drop the title there bub."
Vin Hoo,"Come on  - since this post is already laden with fallacies, what's one more.? Surely Trump can claim that Dr Biden's PhD is bogus ....."
Wiley Wright,"Your are all missing the point.  Jill Biden has a bogus Ed. D., not a Ph.D. Read and understand."
William Schrader,"Dear Joe:It is never a good idea to display your ignorance in public.Do you know the correct way to present advanced degree titles after a surname? I didn't think so. Let me enlighten you:The correct order is to list degrees in order of their seniority, i.e., when that degree was first offered in academia. And the winner is: The Doctor of Philosophy, abbreviated ""Ph.D."" That degree precedes the Doctor of Medicine  degree, abbreviated ""M.D.,"" by a couple hundred years.  So in print a person with dual degrees would show their accomplishments this way:""Mary Smith, M.D., Ph.D.""A person who has received the Ph.D. degree is every bit deserving of the title ""Dr.""  So, too, is any bona fide doctorate --including the Ed.D., D.V.M, D.O., and others for which appropriate training has been carried out by the recipient and for which a panel of faculty have examined and approved  the academic performance of the candidate.Dr. William Schradera.k.a. William Schrader, Ph.D."
Thomas Jones,The beauty of our country is that we are all allowed our opinions and the ability to voice them.  This is yours.  I am always grateful for our differences and continue to believe that there is room in our world for them.mrs
Matthew Haley,"Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but not to their facts. An honorary degree is factually not equivalent to an earned degree. All Ph.D.s are Drs. by Definition. We even call Dentists Dr., even though they aren't MDs either."
John Harris,"I hope ""Dr Jill""  ...  is good with those defibrillator blades !!"
Vin Hoo,Dr Atlas told us to inject bleach ....
Rick Maybury,"Mind boggling.  Of all the important global news to report, why does such a prestigious publication as the WSJ take up valuable space with this insignificant article.   The content and context of this article do not warrant the most minor of thought.    The WSJ editors are slipping in their rigor and professionalism."
John Beghin,It creates utils.  See the number of comments and the fun people are having here....
Lucas Stewart,"Wall Street Journal, this is disgraceful. The gripe about African American women being on honorary degree lists is racist and disturbing. I'm a lifelong WSJ devotee and am thinking of cancelling after you let what sounds like a Proud Boy publish this op ed."
Thomas Jones,"It does not sound like a proud boy piece to anyone who does not go first to identity politics.  Those who have spent any time in higher Ed likely feel the same way about honorary PhDs, for anyone of any religion or race.  It does not make us bad people.mrs"
Matthew Haley,Dr. Biden doesn't have an honorary degree. Only Joey does. Dr. Biden earned her degree. 
John Harris,"Somebody in the White House faints, fall to the floor.... Instinctively, a call for Dr. Jill, and then waste valuable brain -draining seconds with the necessary clarification? The White House has almost always had an MD White House Physician. (... a 60 yrs active surgeon)"
Tony Larino,Pointless.  Petty.  But also deeply sexist.   The WSJ should withdraw this piece.
John Pound,It's an op-ed. Demanding someone's opinion be withdrawn is petty and pointless.Argue against it by all means. Sexist? When you are a public figure you don't get to hide behind your physical attributes anymore...
Beth Radtke,"So since you refuse to believe that this piece would never have asked a man to drop the title doesn't mean that sexism doesn't exist. If physical attributes truly don't matter, then this article wouldn't have been written."
John Pound,So since you refuse to believe that this piece would never have asked a man to drop the title doesn't mean that sexism doesn't exist.I take it you didn't actually read the piece....
Kim Adamson,"I'm a Republican woman (not a Biden supporter, nor Trump for that matter) who will at some point get my degree in water policy, not medicine. And I will absolutely go by Dr.   No one calls me Mrs or kiddo now because it is minimizing my professional status.  This article is offensive beyond belief and since WSJ defended publishing this piece, I will be canceling my subscription.  I would hope WSJ wouldn't post an op-Ed in which a racist referred to people of color by disrespectful terms.  Yet it seems to be okay to disrespect women.  Just a side note, I've never seen any pushback in the Journal about referring to Martin Luther King as Dr.  "
Jonathan Hohn,"As others have expressed, I'm not quite sure what the point of the article was. Until recently, I did not realize her doctorate was a Ph.D. and not an M.D., but beside the point the thrust of the article seemed a bit petty. I'm not sure Mr. Epstein is in any position to case doubt on the work it took to earn her degree. The constant mentioning of his honorary degree got a bit tiresome. It seems the author really like to mention it and is proud of it for some reason. The WSJ is better than this type of writing and understand the opinion page has lower standards than the news division, but this is simply dismaying. I expect more from this and would hope that the negative reactions you have received cause additional more thoughtful review of pieces that grace the pages. "
John Pound,"What's funny is other than mentioning her in the 1st and last paragraphs, commenters in the main focus solely on those two paragraphs to the exclusion of the rest which never mention her.She's the wife of the POTUS-elect and is now part of the public discourse. He's looking at her to set an example...she of course is not bound to do so..."
Tom Park,"I subscribed to WSJ to read intelligent articles based on truth, not articles filled with lies and overtly sexist and racist arguments.  This article discredits every other contributor and article on the WSJ.  I will not support any company that would approve such disinformation to be published.   I just cancelled my subscription to WSJ effective immediately.  "
John Pound,"It's an op-ed, not an article.I'd like to see a comparison of threats of cancellation vs actual cancellations when this kerfuffle dies down..."
John Court,"It's just a lame low blow.  The fact that Epstein can't find better things to write about says a lot about him, unfortunately.  I think less of my WSJ subscription."
Antonia Sears,"I have purposely kept my subscription to WSJ this year as an attempt to balance my media intake in this year of chaos and political absurdity but his just may push me to cancel. Epstein clearly has an inferiority complex - did a woman beat you out of a promotion? An honorary doctorate is nothing, a real doctorate is something earned. And the bit about delivering a baby, seriously? "
Anthony de Jasay,"Pretentiousness among arrivistes is no big deal: but their vanity and fragility can be a matter for public concern, and Epstein's article is fully justified, pointing that out."
Beth Radtke,"So any Dr. that hasn't delivered a baby now practices pretentiousness. I thought conservatives reward those who work hard. Apparently obtaining a degree doesn't count. Oh, I know, it's not real work. But then why doesn't everyone have one if its so easy?"
Alexander Senkoff,"I had a friend who had some type of  ""doctorate"" degree and insisted on being referred to as doctor. Every time that happened, the other party would say ""wow, what is your specialty doctor?"" and then the awkward explanation would follow. why mislead people? use professor or something similar. "
Beth Radtke,Because they earned the title. Compensating for other people's misunderstandings is not the responsibility of the degree holder.
Andrew Colin,how many times will you post in this thread defending this shamefulness? 
Todd Stuart,"Joseph Epstein's criticism of degree inflation, particularly in the fields of the social sciences and humanities, seems apt. Even in some science fields degree inflation exists. You can now obtain a masters of science in dental hygiene. Next time you have your teeth cleaned, consider inquiring about your hygienist's credentials. Are some of these degrees necessary or are they primarily a means for schools to increase revenue?"
Lou Kuhlmann,A fine article; keep them coming!
Allen Lewis,"Unless you are a  medical doctor, you are a Mr. or a Mrs. (and you don't get to choose). "
STEPHEN SMITH,Why MD and not PHd?  PHd has been around for about 600 years longer than the MD.
Bobby Linaberry,"Life according to Allen.According to Merriam Webster: DoctorPlease note 1 b) and c):Definition of doctor (Entry 1 of 2)
1aChristianity : an eminent theologian declared a sound expounder of doctrine by the Roman Catholic Church
- called also doctor of the church

b: a learned or authoritative teacher
c: a person who has earned one of the highest academic degrees (such as a PhD) conferred by a university
Most of the college's faculty members are doctors in their fields.
The class is being taught by Doctor Menzer.
d: a person awarded an honorary doctorate (such as an LLD or Litt D) by a college or university"
Jim Crowell,"Provocative, yes. Substantive, no. Logically consistent, no. Interesting, no. Humorous, no. Entertaining, not much. Really, what was the point of this piece? How does it get into the WSJ? Provocative for its own sake? It does not even seem to be self-serving (as the author admits to having no degree which would allow him to call himself ""doctor""). I will continue to subscribe to the WSJ, which generally offers great reporting, but the paper has reduced its standing in printing such tripe. "
Joseph G,NA
laney watkins,"This is exactly why I usually stay away from the Op Ed section of the WSJ.  The author could've taken up less print space and just said, ""You know, in my day, we didn't have to respect women."""
Tom Park,"I agree.  The WSJ did allow these lies to be published on their platform, making them enablers of disinformation like this.  "
James Stokien,"I was discussing the  subject of Dr. Biden with my mother-in-law the other day. She told me about having dinner years ago with a friend who was a former ambassador and a PhD professor at Harvard. The former ambassador regularly used the honorific ""Doctor"" when making restaurant reservations, hoping it would get him a better table. One evening, my in-laws were dinning with the ambassador and  his wife when a member of the kitchen staff approached the table and asked the ""doctor"" to follow him. When the former ambassador got to the kitchen, he was confronted with a line cook who had deeply sliced his hand open. The ""doctor"" almost fainted. "
Robert Shreiner,I don't understand why the WSJ Editorial Board would give this man a platform.  Simply embarrassing for any serious newspaper.  
Michael Rowan,"Can someone remind me of the WSJ Refund policy? I'm nearing renewal time (this article helped make that decision), but I'm wondering if I can go retroactively to the publication date of this aberration. of intellect in an opinion piece. This noise wasn't worthy of this forum, especially from such an uninformed and out of date (what's the opposite of kiddo?) author."
Beth Radtke,"Here is a shorter way to have stated your opinion. ""Here dear, put on this degree burka as your intelligence threatens me."""
Melissa Frazier,If Epstein had actually attended a real university he would know that calling Professors by the title Dr. is just as common as calling a medical doctor by the title Dr.  Perhaps he is just jealous of Dr. Biden for actually achieving the pinnacle of her career when he did not have the motivation to do it himself.  It appears that he is adhering to the philosophy that there is no bad publicity.
Paul Taylor,"The lowest 5% of academic performers enroll in ""education"" curricula as a career path.Nice try Jill."
Beth Radtke,"She earned the doctorate. If it was so easy, why didn't you earn one?"
Hector Ramos,Can you provide data or a citation for that?  What measure of academic performance?  What type of education degree? Which department?  Or is this just conjecture based on something you read on the internet?
Eric Cowley,"Why expend energy on retention at any college?  For those whom conventional school work is a bore, there is the school of hard knocks.  After a few years at the school of hard knocks, one either finds themselves satisfied, or motivated. The motivated may decide to return to college, with knowledge as their goal, and tolerate or perhaps challenge the ineptness of many teachers and hold them to account.  Good money is being spent, money honorably earned and invested with knowledge as the return."
Christopher Taylor,"I'm still trying to figure out why WSJ even printed such a piece. What purpose does it serve? If I occasionally forget that Murdock owns you, things like this remind me. "
GEORGINA PHILLIPS,"This is a disgraceful opinion piece. Having worked for many years in the medical field with some of the greatest research scientists in the world, I've worked with many ""Doctors"" who were NOT MD's. How ignorant of Mr. Epstein, and shame on the WSJ for publishing this nonsense!"
David Rich,"Obama  was the  chosen one, will Jill be the madonna?"
Vito DiPaola,"Unless I missed it, this column only discusses Bill Cosby's honorary degrees. He also has a PhD in education, awarded by the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. His dissertation was about his Fat Albert character. I wish I were kidding about this. "
Sue Maple,"I am very offended by the content of this article.  From the style and content of the article, I must assume that Epstein (no Mr. or Dr.) must live his life in the alternate universe of all Trumpers - where facts do not matter.  Or should I say where only their facts matter.  Everyone who has been granted the right to use the title Dr. from a institution of higher learning has earned that right.  If you are offended or put off by the use of this title, the issue is with you not those who have earned the right to Dr."
Sue Maple,"My name is Dr. Steve Maple and I wrote the comment above.  My wife, Dr. Sue Maple owns the subscription.  Any issues with the comment take it up with me."
Rhodes Hambrick,"As a medical doctor, I find this piece horrifyingly sexist and misogynistic. I called my professors in undergrad ""doctor"" throughout. She has earned this title and while it would admittedly be confusing to use the title in a medical setting, she is not traveling to hospitals posing as a physician, she is being addressed in accordance with a title she's earned. Shame on you for writing this Op-Ed, and shame on the WSJ for publishing it. I'm ending my subscription today."
Neeraj Monga,"This opinion piece is illegitimate intellectual output masquerading as opinion. The WSJ should know better than to provide a platform for meaningless drivel. To refer to The First Lady (""elect"") as Kiddo, in the introductory sentence foreshadows ""drivel ahead""! Perhaps the author was on cloud nine after ingesting  some of the recently introduced especially flavoured gummy bears for adults.  The author of such exalted thinking and writing should commend himself by walking into the Grand Canyon abyss. After all he exhibits a grand vision of nothingness. "
GEORGE SCHUPP,"I'm inclined to agree with Whoopi Goldberg.  I think she's a terrific doctor.Who has seen ""Best in Show""?  Fred Willard, one of the funniest people ever, says to his partner in the broadcast booth something about his sore elbow. Oh, not that kind of doctor?Mr. Epstein has made a wonderful point here. Though one may have earned the prefix ""Dr."" in another discipline, let's not diminish in this time of stress for all of us the very real value of the term ""Doctor"" applied to medical professionals.  After the first nine months of 2020, they have truly earned it."
william holbrook,"All phd's will no longer be called ""doctor"" or does this just apply to Jill Biden?  Hmmm sexist, political, ....? Just stupid.  There are a lot more really important things to be pontificating about. Grow up."
Tad Schell,"It is not uncommon for democrats to claim to be something that they are not, Senator Warren for example."
Beth Radtke,or like Republicans to claim they won the election.
Todd Deutscher,"Right Tad.Who was it who said... ISIS: ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" Social media: ""I understand social media. I understand the power of Twitter. Courts: ""I know more about courts than any human being on Earth."" Trade: ""Nobody knows more about trade than me."" Renewable energy: ""I know more about renewables than any human being on Earth.""Taxes: ""I think nobody knows more about taxes than I do, maybe in the history of the world.""

Ronald Koby,I am a financial advisor and have read the WSJ for the past 35 years of my career.  I am about done with you guys.  Rupert Murdoch was the worst thing to ever happen to the Journal. 
Clarence King,Agree...I wondered for a moment if this Opinion piece was intended for the New York Post and ended up in the WSJ my mistake.
Leon Kenman,"M. Epstein:I don't know if you're a fool or an idiot, but as you mention, academic doctorates allow the title of  Dr. to their recipients.  If I'm wrong about the appellation I conferred on you, then stop wasting people's time on carping trivia.Dr. KenmanPS:  Different milieux have different cultures which project their preferences.  E.g., A&S generally eschews the Dr. title, whereas schools of business and education love it.  Explore a useful topic.  Are you aggrieved because Melanija's education level is low, along with tRump's.    "
S. McKay Price,"Is this a personal attack based on one's political and/or linguistic preferences, or commentary on advanced degrees? Regardless, this is a poorly written article. As a side note:Physician = A specific term describing someone with a doctorate in medicine (M.D., D.O.)Dr. = A general term describing someone with a doctorate in any field (Ed.D., D.S.W, Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S.,  etc)Honorary doctorates are something entirely different and shouldn't be lumped into the same conversation as earned degrees."
Cathey Chaffee," Joe ... Joey ... bucky, when a person earns a doctorate -- not handed an ""honorable"" degree as swag, but earns -- they have conferred upon them ""all the rights and privileges thereunto appertaining."" One of those rights is to be addressed as Doctor.  By your guideline, a cop, taxi driver, or even you would have the right to the title if you delivered a baby in the backseat of the car or the floor of Walmart. I realize it's your opinion, but it doesn't align with fact. "
Vonda D'Errico,"I would just note that the MSM consistently refused to address Ben Carson as Dr. Ben Carson and he was a renowned neurosurgeon who had performed groundbreaking surgeries on conjoined twins.  My mother taught in public schools for 35 years.  She had nothing but contempt for those with PhD's in education, since most had never actually stepped foot in a classroom or, if they had, couldn't wait to get out.  Getting their PhD was a ticket into a cushy administrative job telling other people how to do a job they themselves couldn't do."
Eric Robinson,"Could you please cite any evidence for the fact that the ""MSM"" consistently refused to address Dr. Carson by his title?  "
Richard Murphy,"I know all the wokies out there are incensed by this, but go to UDel and see the requirements for an Ed.D --1)  no GRE reqs -- just 3 recommendations2)  it is not intended to be a research degree -- if you actually want to work for your doctorate that would be the Ph.D. route, but Jill has an Ed.D in educational leadership3)  Read the course requirements -- those, along with the title of her dissertation sort of indicate that this isn't a demanding course of study4)  I don't think that Jill had to drop out of her professional career for four years to pursue this degree.So, call Jill Doctor if it gives you a tingle in your leg -- but the distance between her degree (you can even get it online now) and an MD or a serious Ph.D. (one in a rigorous area of study) are night and day different.  So call Jill Doc, call Joe ""Big Buy"" and call Hunter and bro Jim honest businessmen.  Knock yourselves out  "
Jack Heslin,"Mr. Epstein's real point is about declining academic standards and false academic credentials. That's a debate worth having. But to bookend the debate with opening and closing  snide comments at a woman who has called herself ""Dr."" for years is cheap and, quite frankly, stupid.  "
Clarence King,"and the fact that Mr. Epstein  was editor of the American Scholar, the quarterly magazine of Phi Beta Kappa only proves your point about declining academic standards.It must have been a day of few entries for the WSJ."
TERESA BOHLMEYER,"I agree with Mr. Epstein. Being addressed as ""Dr"" should be reserved for those who have taken on great responsibility as part of their daily work( ie making life and death decisions)."
Anthony Sugalski,"What do you think of psychologists using the term ""Dr."" with a PhD degree? Psychologists often deal with suicidal patients and need to make life and death decisions as a result."
LYNN MYERS,"Tell  me what their malpractice costs and I will tell  you if they are a ""real"" doctor."
Michael B,The Ph.D. predates the M.D. A medical degree is vocational training. 
Mary Taylor,Mid-Century Modern design is on-trend now. Mid-Century thinking shows the lack of education and study of the progress our society has made in the past 70 years. 
Samuel Spear Jr,"I subscribe to the WSJ out of curiosity to hear and appreciate different opinions.  However, I do have a line not to cross on the opposing trash I want to hear. e.g. racism, misogyny, anti-science, sedition, etc.I am not part of any coordinated response.  I am insulted by your response suggesting such.I just expected better journalism and enlightenment, even on the right.BYE"
Adam Raskin,"From the word ""kiddo,"" on, this is a truly patronizing, sexist, inane piece.  Dr. Biden not only deserves the title she earned, but she is a serious educator, devoted to her craft and to her students.  That Mr. Epstein wasted his ink on attempting to disparage her says a lot more about him than it does about her.  What a shame."
Peter Torab,"As others have said, there is probably a point to be made here, but this article is just terrible.  The most frustrating thing is that many people who don't read WSJ have mentioned this piece, and it certainly reflects poorly on the entire paper.  "
Katherine Bailey,"Michelle:  sleeveless dress.Jill:  Ed. D.Melania:  I have wonderful news for fussy old hens like Epstein: I earned  a Ph.D. in 2009 and did the two languages including one classical, the defense, the whole nerve-wracking nine yards.  Civilization is not yet completely dead.  Glory!Some conservatives think this situation is worthy of comment in WSJ.  I guess that makes sense: there's so little else going on in the world and the USA.  And we really have to stop Democrats from committing these egregious crimes.  As soon as the Republicans manage to overturn a legal election and install their tinpot dictator, I'm sure that'll be on the agenda, along with a few other items of import like removing democracy, and easier pandemic profiteering."
SCOTT SMITH,"She has a doctorates degree in education which entitles her to it.Most doctorates do not that I know, use that title or initials.  It becomes confusing for the general public but the correct honorific for a physician is ""MD"" not ""Dr"" in any case.Ms Biden is well within her rights and custom to use this as in Dr. Martin Luther King.  Many others have the degree and in academic circles it is more common and acceptable to use."
Brian Klein,This reminds me of Ghostbusters - Mr Vinkman - Dr. Vinkman.  So you are a doctor?  I have PhDs in Psychology and Parapsychology.  
TIM DAWSON,Bravo Mr. Epstein for calling out another chapter of Biden malarkey. 
Eric Robinson,"Ah yes, the malarky of obtaining doctorate degree.  "
K H,"Nothing good happens after ""kiddo."" Stand down, Joe. "
Thomas Davis,"When I was in graduate school at a Big Ten university in the mid 90's, we were instructed that the public use of doctor was to be reserved for physicians-MD's, dentists, optometrists, etc.  .  PhD.s should expect to go by Mr./Mrs./Ms.  This came from a professor with doctorates in Library Science and Classics.  This article is a bit snarky, but it does reflect  that this use of Dr. these days is watered down, and that is a recent development, with a host of sociological issues  rather than academic concerns driving it.  "
Michael B,I began my doctorate in the mid-90s and there was no such expectation that I recall.I don't think the use of the title is watered down. I cannot recall anyone or even hearing about anyone adopting the title because he or she received an honorary degree. 
Leon Kenman,A&S eschews the title Dr. as you point out.  Schools of business and education love it.  Climb out of your hole and observe the big picture.  
Thomas Davis,"Well, ok then.  I am in education, and have met many who hold EdD's, and have found few who distinguish themselves academically or intellectually.   The honorific does little to paper that over.  I know of no business PhD's who insist on it, but maybe that is because of my limited view down here in the hole, where most EdDs live.  How do we now refer to Dr. Bill Cosby?"
Ryan Somers,"There is a serious article that can be written here. The commoditization of advanced college degrees, in a system that is already exploiting a generation into extreme debt levels are liberal arts PhDs helping to drive this problem? But.... that's not what it's about and this article is pretty awful. "
Jon Rozhon,"I agree with the thrust of this argument about PhD's, but referring to any woman as ""kiddo"" is simply ignorant.  And to offer criticism of Dr. Biden's dissertation by referring only to its title is lazy.  How did this piece get past the other WSJ editors?  Making a larger argument through the hook of a personal attack is beneath the WSJ.  It is not as though we are suffering through weeks on end of slow news days; there are more important matters to discuss today than the letters before a person's name and far more dignified ways for America's foremost business newspaper to make its editorial arguments.  Resignations are in order. "
James Sheehan,The Doctor designation is a joke but the media will use it to the max.
Lisabeth Weiner,Shameful of the WSJ to print this rubbish. Simply shameful.
william casto,My son it working on a PHD in neuroscience at the University of Texas. He and his fellow students have disdain for MD's. They work less time for their degrees and come out as prescription writers contributing nothing to research. He will deserve his Dr. in front of his name where these prescription writers can be replaced by a physician's assistant to do there writhing for them.
Kurt Helm,Chauvinist opinion writer. He seems to live in a time 50 years before today.
jes merrell,"The opinion is trash. What is worse is now 48 hours after they publish this screed, and having received as a minimum 2000 strongly critical comments, the Murdoch led WSJ sits smugly and does nothing.No apology, no retraction, nothing.If you continue  to reward such garbage thru a subscription you too are Joe Epstein or is that Jeffrey? "
Michael B,Nope. They responded by doubling down and blaming cancel culture 
Jeff Richwagen,"The truth hurts. The chronicled, long, slow decline of education is both shameful and embarrassing.  It does, however,  go a long way  in explaining the intellectual deficit of the general post modern morass we find ourselves in.. "
Alisha Stegall,"Mr. Epstein is astounding that you have a problem with a WOMAN having a degree, let alone the first lady. But you would be OK with having another first lady WITH NO DEGREES AT ALL. I think that you should use your precious time to find something else to write about. Lets show our children how to be respectful and to be a  good sport ... ok ""kiddo""?"
Richard Skalski,"Joe, this is the very best piece you have written!!!!!"
Leon Kenman,I shudder to think how wasteful those other pieces are.  
S GK,"Wow, amazed that this is the type of Op-ed the WSJ wants to associate with. I get it you are a conservative publication and the Orange man you championed lost fair and square. But as a female I take serious offense to making everything political. In a year that's been tough on everyone, especially women in the work force I can't believe this is the direction you want to go in.....I for one am proud to call Dr Jill Biden my First Lady and thank her for being a role model to all!"
Robert Dye,I'm sorry I waisted time reading the article and energy thinking about it. Shame on the WSJ.
MICHAEL SOUZA,"It's clear that Mr. Epstein harbors a little animosity of working in academia his whole career without a PhD and have to apologize constantly for not being a Dr.  What a sad, small minded man.  This sounds like a personal problem to me.By my understanding an MD can be called DR after 4 years of med school, a PhD takes a minimum of 6. Who has worked harder or deserves it more?  Lastly, shame on the WSJ for publishing such a vapid and nonsensical opinion piece.  This is not just an attack on Dr.Biden, but every PhD across the globe.  What's the point of disenfranchising the 10's of thousands of PhD across the country that have worked hard in so many different areas of study?  "
Cindy Fryman,"Because my wife was a teacher I knew several teachers with a PhD in education. I knew they have the title but, frankly, the title was only used when attending a professional event such as a conference.I'm guessing that the media is using it to perceptually elevate Joe's intellect, since it is not an association with Joe. Ironically, Joe's wife has a PhD in education and his chief association is with plagiarism.The media will swoon over everything Biden over the next four years.  They will try to keep us seeing past the idea that they propped up mediocrity during the campaign.Tom F"
Leon Kenman,PfffftThis was flagged?!   Things must be slow and low at WSJ.  
DOUGLAS ANDERSON,"Didn't vote for Joe Biden and have never voted for a Democrat... BUT... physician's don't own the title ""doctor""."
Prashanth Reddy,"why did WSJ even publish this?  Should we take away the  'doctor' titles from the millions of PH.D's around the country both male and female, both civilian and government officials?  I think this article is a let down from WSJ.  "
keith mcphail,"We are close to having lost 300,000 people to Coronavirus and the President of the United States hasn't said a word!If we were still using a print based media, would this article have made the cut with the editors?  More a waste of space don't you think?  We should be focusing on the large items instead of sniping at this inconsequential topic."
Elise Morano,Yes. This. Bravo.
Teresa Frey,I called and canceled my subscription.  This kiddo decided the Journal isn't worthy of my money.
Joshua Anthony,I'll be following you out the door.
Michael Byington,"The Merriam-Webster dictionary shared a page exploring the origins of the word ""doctor,"" which noted that though modern English primarily uses ""doctor"" to refer to those who practice medicine, it stems from the Latin word for ""teacher."" "
WILLIAM HOBBS,"PhD stands for Doctor of Philosophy; MD for Medical Doctor;  EdD for Doctor of Education.  All may use the prefix ""Dr"" but the importance of doing so depends upon the context.  Where clarification is required, the qualifying suffix is added or the suffix may be used alone. I have not found it important to use either prefix or suffix for the past 30 years or so."
WILLIAM HOBBS,"In the next 4 years you had better be careful to refer to the elites by their ""preferred prefix"" or the wrath of the Progressives will descend upon you.  Prefixes are needed by those who fear their superiority will not otherwise be noted.  For the rest of us, the prefix ""Deplorable"" will suffice."
Matt Naughton,"This is nothing more than sexist whining, and highly disappointing that WSJ's publication of it suggests misogyny is a legitimate perspective"
Holly Rollefson,This is disappointing. 
Gray Cooper,"I understand his point; however ""kiddo"" is entirely inappropriate.  Its disrespectful and condescending.  The WSJ should know better than to allow that kind of disparaging rhetoric.  "
Diane Whelton,Ach du lieber!  Humor ist verboten!
Michelle Sutherland,"President-elect Biden has addressed other adults as ""Kiddo,"" including his wife, Dr. Jill Biden.  This was meant to be a humorous piece, and frankly, it made me chuckle because it points out hypocrisy on many levels.  Since when did we stop making fun of our politicians?"
Teresa Frey,I chuckled too as I cancelled my subscription.
Michael Woloshin,Safe travels 
Jeff Richwagen,See-Ya!  I just renewed  my subscription
Jon Rozhon,"Maybe it was meant to be humorous, but boy did it ever fall flat! I agree it is fine to make fun of politicians, but Jill Biden isn't a politician.  "
ROBERT HACKER,"One does not dare to critique democrats in power, lest you receive the wrath of liberals, socialists and media; but who cares?"
DON ROSS,"I would posit that the proverbial low information voters can easily figure out for themselves that Mrs. Biden is not a medical doctor, as no one that was an actual ""doctor"" would allow, much less encourage her patient to undertake such a colossal undertaking as being President, given his obviously declining mental and physical health!"
Glenn Donovan,"Anyone who's spent their time with non-humanities PhD types understands the point made here. The Dr honorific slips out occasionally to eye rolls.  An Ed doctorate is an even lower threshold than a PhD, lol. But then Jill is given a platform here. Wow. The wife of a corrupt political crime family leader - I guarantee you she's spent some Chines or Kazak or Ukrainian money. Apparently one mechanism was providing family members with pre-paid Visa cards with ill gotten loot.James Biden - the brother - and Hunter- are the subjects of at least 5 DoJ investigations at the moment. Will Jill be next?"
David Sims,"That an honorific ""slips out occasionally to eye rolls"" shows how far America has fallen on the international landscape.  We used to be a country that valued learning, expertise, and accomplishment.An EdD is a research and professional doctoral degree in the field of education, designed to address real-world issues, as opposed to the PhD, which is of a more theoretical nature.

Both are doctoral degrees, and at most institutions there is an almost complete overlap between curriculum and dissertation requirements for the two degrees.  Some institutions offer an EdD, some a PhD, and some both.And the bogus assertions about being corrupt, disgusting.  This coming in light of a president who had to shut down a charity for kids with cancer, because he was stealing from those kids...who had to pay millions for running a ""university"" that scammed people....for having to make agreements with the government because he discriminated in housing...etc.This is repugnant in so many ways."
Glenn Donovan,"Gigging. I made no bogus assertions - you are being deceptive. The DoJ announced an investigation into James Biden and 4 separate investigations of Hunter Biden. All based on financial dealings they've had related to selling their family name. That you don't like these documented facts is your issue - not mine.As for whether she's called a Dr. or not you simply do not roll in the circles I do. I work with many people holding technical PhDs and none of them refer to themselves as ""Dr."" and it's seen as very try-hard to do so. It is interesting that this upset you so much. if you think this is rough, I guess you missed how the Dems behaved over the past 4 years. We are no longer being polite or civil or giving an inch.Welcome to the politics your side created. "
Nancy Wood,"by Matthew Wood, MD:Don't forget the problem of nurse practitioners who obtain PhD's in public health and then refer to themselves as""Dr"" in their practice of medicine...."
James Holst,They don't.  No RN-P in their right mind would do that.
ERNIE FRED GAYNES,"How does the WSJ even think about publishing a letter like this one, from such a small minded man?   Would it ever be said about a man with a legitimate doctorate?   I guess the editorial  board ran out of make Trump supporters to make excuses for his behavior?"
Brian Frost,It's 100% appropriate to let the low information voters out there know that Jill Biden is not a medical doctor. First Lady Jill Biden is fine. 
David Sims,"It's appropriate that ""low information voters"" inform themselves.  Democracy requires participation, which requires more than living as a couch potato downing beers and watching trash tv.  Why is it ""appropriate"" to coddle such voters?  Wouldn't it be to their benefit as much as anyone's, for them to actually learn something?"
Vrinder Randhawa,"wow, i am an international reader; Epstein reminds of a Doctor who work in the NHS, and his obsequious fawning to a by gone age, when minorities, women and patients are the vassals of his success. With a management style more attune to a sanatorium he abuses his patients as #1 no rules #2 i'm in charge #3 i've worked harder than anyone else.  I'm definitely heading over the Times."
Glenn Donovan,Go right ahead...
Geoffrey Gilbert,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself 'Dr.' unless he has delivered a child.""Mostly ignoring the fact the sentence starts with the statement that apparently only men are doctors, let's pick apart this one sentence alone:1. By this logic Neurosurgeons, Pharmacist, and Oncologist should never call themselves doctors... because they likely never delivered a baby.2. Dr. Jill Biden did deliver a child, her daughter when she gave birth to her.  Unless Mr. Epstein's suggestion is women are passive participants in childbirth.  I think most women readers would disagree.3. ""A wise man once said,"" is a cheap way to say something, but try to not own it, without specifically having to cite any credible source.But I don't supposed I would expect to get any better from Mr. Epstein.  This is the kind easy to destroy arguments I expect to see from undergrads, like Mr. Epstein.  Although some of his points about education might be true, he was a poor messenger w/ weak arguments."
soren brockdorf,Perfect response. I am also pretty sure PhDs were doctors way before there were medical doctors.
Geoffrey Gilbert,"Yeah, Mirriam-Webster was quick to point out the origin of the word was actually for teacher and used by those in education long before it was used by those in the medical profession, but again, that would require some research before publican and not just an inherent belief that your position was already correct based on the fact that you had a moderate amount of success in life."
Kathryn Roeder,"I dropped my subscription to the WSJ based on their sneering editorials and don't think I've ever made a better decision.  Epstein is a pompous jerk.  I'm a university professor and we would never dream of hiring a person as unqualified as him to teach our students.  But it is the editor at the journal who deserves our scorn.  Disgusting, sexist idiot!  I hope more subscribers follow my lead and stop giving their money to this publication."
Michael Woloshin,Safe travels. We will miss you.
Charles Jamison,"""Madame First Lady-Mrs. Biden-Jill-kiddo""...""kiddo""??? Thirty years ago --  when Mr. Epstein suggests that rigor and standards were in place -- or now, gentlemen of stature would/should not so casually call in public  another man's wife by the pet name that he uses for her.  Hundreds of years ago in NYC  there would have been a duel between Mr. Biden and Mr. Epstein; I am glad those days are not today and so should Mr. Epstein. "
matilda snow,"""Any billionaire but Rupert""  crowd sadly, is right again.  How pathetic,  how racist,  and  misogynistic----Dr. Jill Biden will make the best First Lady ever, thank God they won and ""bigly.""                  Dr. Jill, Dr. Jill, Dr. Jill.......pretty stark contrast to the last four years. An accomplished educator, a mother,a role model for young women and girls. Sticks in your craw, you old geezer."
Vadim Erent,"Thanks at least for bringing to our attention the impressive dissertation topic which Dr. Biden took on to earn her degree.  What could be more important than researching the conditions that make it possible to support more of our young Americans on their path to an affordable, life-enhancing college degree?   You called Dr. Biden's focus on the retention of community college students ""unpromising?""   What you were researching? Apparently, you were working on a  degree in snark and and jealousy.   Oh wait, you don't even have a doctorate in drivel although you obviously deserve it.   Shame on WSJ for printing this defensive sarcasm (complete with a repulsive, paternalistic ""kiddo"") as a meaningful opinion worth the time of their readers.  -- Dr. Bonita Rhoads, PhD, Comparative Literature, Yale University (deal with it!)"
Lauren Beezer Roche,"""What could be more important than researching the conditions that make it possible to support more of our young Americans on their path to an affordable, life-enhancing college degree?""Many, many things, Vadim. If and when you have read First Lady Biden's dissertation, you can defend it. Humorless, sanctimonious posts are as meaningless as her degree. "
Lauren Beezer Roche,"And ""kiddo"" is a reference to the many times her own husband has called her that publicly. Sarcasm often requires wit and insight, FYI. "
Emily Pickrell,"I called all my professors Dr. - and it never occurred to me to refer to them as 'kiddo'. If we are to be super snobby, I consider a PhD in theoretical physics to be more academically grueling than an M.D. Is that the point? As a journalist myself, an op-ed that just smirks and takes pot shots is one of the easiest to write....I thought the WSJ had higher standards, frankly."
Clive Stocker,"It has never been cool to put down a woman. Never. Epstein is pompous, an out of touch oaf, but so must his editor be for publishing. One hundred years since female suffrage and WSJ allows this. As a proud father of a daughter who already has two degrees I have encouraged her to never understate her achievements, let her employer know they have a smart one on the books. Thankfully she doesn't have to tackle a bore like Epstein in her business. Yet. In a world of dying news journalism it will not remain safe for a woman if this type of man can continue to make the weather. So much of America is now shaped by this type of ""this is what you must think"" trash talk. I saw an image of Epstein wearing a bow tie. I wore these in the 1960's. As a five year old. To parties, where we all ate jello and cake. I know it to be a sign of inflated self opinion in grown men. I also never like to judge a book by its cover, but I turned the pages of Epstein and well, I shall judge. Love you, Dr. Biden!"
Michael B,"This name-dropping (I  taught at Northwestern), part time adjunct lecturer could barely restrain himself from writing ""babe"" instead of kiddo. Titles can be fraught, though. My money-pit of a dog's 37-year-old veterinarian used to call with lab results, ""Hi Michael! It's Dr. Pawsticker from Acme Animal Hospital, how are you?"" To which I eventually said, ""I am 22 years older than you, and resent that you feel comfortable addressing me by my first name while introducing yourself as Dr. Pawsticker. You can call me Mr. or Dr. or Professor if you wish."" He apologized profusely. Now when he calls, he says, ""Hiiiii... it's Dr. Pawsticker."" And I grind my teeth.Dr. Michael B, Ph.D. from Harvard (maybe you heard of it?)"
Joshua Walker,"So you have a PhD from Harvard, but yet are unable to detect the sarcasm from ""kiddo"" which is directed at Joe Biden's disrespectful comments.  Maybe the problem is not with your veterinarian.  "
Michael B,The sarcasm came through loud and clear.
Michael J,"So says the guy who doesn't have a PhD. You sound like the bitter old man that you are, and clearly have a chip on your shoulder and some pent up jealousy.  You act as though she got her degree from Trump University, for which if that was the case, you would have a valid point. "
Paolo Fanti,"Aristides, you are a joke.Paolo Fanti, M.D."
Thomas Lauria,"Cheers to you and the WSJ for calling out a phoney. Prior to reading your op-ed, I assumed Jill Biden was a medical doctor. I would bet good money that I was not alone."
Tim Burchell,"Pay attention just a little and you would have heard about her passion for teaching and education. But, you are right, you are not alone. A lot of people do not pay attention."
Michael J,"Yep, there are a lot of people out there who assume a lot of things but in reality know very little, such as yourself."
Bridget Krause,Peter Navarro always referred to himself as a doctor.     
Phillip Whitt,"This is an erudite opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal that is of a caliber on the level of the Washington Examiner, or perhaps a Parler posting."
Christopher Keim,"Apologize, WSJ and mean it. "
Crawford Taylor,"Remind me again, how many degrees does Melania have?"
K Carroll,"The question should be how many post-graduate degrees have been earned by Mr. Epstein?  It was interesting that when he wrote about honorary degrees (which have nothing to do with Dr. Jill Biden), he never mentioned the honorary degrees bestowed upon our current president."
Phillip Whitt,"Hey Daddy-O, I assume that is your preferred title. What exactly is your point in this opinion piece. I have no doctorate, honorary or otherwise, so I am unable to understand the most erudite bit of wisdom you are attempting to share with the reading public. Thank you."
Lisa Mcgrath,"Epstein, what a loser you are.  Thats why you love Trump, another loser, and were hired by the Wall Street Journal as an Opinion writer."
Julie Keene,"How and why the Journal decided to publish this condescending, sexist column -- ""kiddo?"" Really?-- is a mystery, but perhaps they should be reminded that PhDs were doctors when barbers were surgeons. "
Michael B,"How much do you want to bet that ""babe"" or ""doll"" or ""sweetheart"" was in an earlier draft? "
Mike Ring,Just to see Jill Biden's name in the same article as the lowlife Stephen Colbert'smade my day.  Once again let's not hesitate to put the Biden family throughany and every indignation we can uncover or concoct in the next four years.The Trump family endured it and prevailed.
T Andrew Young,It is this type of thinking that turned the American people away from Trump.  People are tired of the constant name calling and bullying.  You may be part of the 74M but you are still in the minority.  I'd be embarrassed and ashamed for that post.  So much hate.  It needs to change.
JEREMY MOORMAN,"What a garbage opinion piece.  WSJ, be better."
JON SELTZER,"This has to be the dumbest article I ever have seen, and I wonder if the Murdochs hands off approach is no longer hands off.Really a guy with no fid is criticizing people that have them!The real issue here is the fact that WSJ gave this fool a voice.I got a year subscription for 50 bucks.    If they keep on publishing ridiculous article like this I may cancel, having the paper not be worth it at any price."
Jim Pettyjohn,doctor = teacher
ANURADHA G PAI,"This is one of the  most ""nothing"" pieces I have ever read in the WSJ.   Looks like Mr.  Epstein had a difficult time coming up with a subject to write about.  Waste of time.(Cliff)"
Kim Sandarusi,"Joe-baby, Why was so much of this article ABOUT you, as though you were some sort of litmus test against which you can test who has genuine credentials?  You bristle because someone has a credential and chooses to express it.  And then write about it in the WSJ, where one commentator has opined ""has descended into superciliousness"".  You have no business or standing in this matter and your opinion has no merit.To wit, ""Doctor"" is derived from the latin verb ""docere"" which means ""to teach"".. and doesn't mean ""to heal""... but then, you knew that."
Fred Douglas,"Dear Mr Epstein. 

Thank you for showing again that it is only ""safe"" to even venture to ""offend"" white, straight males. All others are ""protected classes"" that require special quotas (board, management and entry level now), allowances, lower bank rates, and a couple hundred extra SAT points. Clearly our society (well, the Democrat Party ""woke"" portion) has decided all these groups can't keep up and need permanent, extra credit. 
"
JD Hardee,"I've had the same opinion for years.  It's curiously out of place for the popular media to have used the term ""Doctor"" to discuss a politicians wife.  I'm sure she's great in the one class she teaches at the community college.  It's probably meant a lot to the academy to read her voluminous publishing.  But to refer to Jill Biden as Dr. Biden outside academia?  Fraudulent at best.   Kind of like the story today about Joe being a churchgoer.  Just a little bit of character rehab for the Bidens courtesy of the fawning press."
Julie Keene,"They called Henry Kissinger ""Dr."" And Dr. Brzezinski. Why not Dr. Biden? Let me guess: because the writer doesn't have a doctorate himself--and he's a man!Well, I'm not sure he's a man, but he's passing as one."
Garnier Nicolas,"Trump's ""doctor"" at Walter Reed was an Osteopath (D.O.), not a M.D.  Just saying."
M. Lynn Pappas,I went back to look for this piece after seeing today's rebuttal to the predictable backlash. Boy this is soft stuff.  If the Biden's and their ilk can't take this kind of heat they better immediately evacuate the White House kitchen.  Try facing. the same level of pressure and insults directed at the Trump family.   You wanted the fish bowl......you got it so learn how to swim. 
vincent marchionna,"I imagine First Lady Biden is an excellent teacher and commend her for entering this profession. But , writing a dissertation on ""How to Retain Students in the Community College System"" doesn't seem to have the gravitas compared to someone who performs surgery and administers to the unhealthy. Not a real doctor."
Christian Hoffmann,"Ever heard of Dr. Henry Kissinger ? Dr. Albert Einstein ? Dr. Stephen Hawking ? If not ( I doubt it, but you never know), then how about Dr. Who ?Or did you think they were all doctors of medicine before they become famous in other fields ?"
Fred Douglas,"They carried these designations but never themselves insisted on being called ""doctor"" in casual or polite conversation. They were also, even today, mostly referred to by simply their names. That is sufficient, their achievements are more than mere paper awards; that is the reason we remember them. Dr. Who is, of course, imaginary.  It's like trying to define why Mrs. Biden has the title ... takes a lot of creativity. "
John Gall," Oh! This was about society's toupee, Phds.  Are people really persuaded by such garnishments?  Titles of distinction are just like money,  you can only print so much of it, before it becomes worthlessLet's check out what the polls say, before we rush to judgement on the matter."
Christian Hoffmann,"This is the WSJ editorial page for you:  No woman is ever good enough, nor is any man's opinion ever to be dismissed for being wrong.I'd imagine that advising Dr. Henry Kissinger not to use his Dr. title never even occurred to Epstein."
Fred Douglas,"Ah, that must be it. It was about it being an article where the subject was a person in a ""protected class"". If lib's didn't have ""poor victims"", I am not entirely sure they would have a party.  Character is no longer a key attribute, what really matters is how 'offended' and - in this case - how petty one can be. "
Christopher Smith,"Remember, Trump told you that all of you lemmings are ""victims"". Don't bring that weak sauce here. ""No snowflake, you're the snowflake"". Better to be a lib than a Con-man. "
Bryan Hight,"Barney Fife always registered at hotels as ""Bernard Fife, M.D"" (Mayberry deputy)."
MARK GIBBONS,"How small and petty, but sadly not surprising from the WSJ."
James Melancon,"A Doctorate of Education is a professional practice degree that is academically on par with a doctoral degree in medicine, dentistry, legal or any other professional degree.  To weaken a doctoral degree in education simply because it is not a medical degree is appalling and in the case of Mr. Epstein , sexist and should be beneath the dignity of true journalistic integrity.  It is appalling that the editorial board allowed this to be published as they should have known better.  From a journalistic standpoint, it falls short.  From a moral standpoint, there are no words.  "
Charles Mann,".... ah, but here in Germany titles are so very important that I have seen people using the Dr. Dr. Max Mustermann  in their signature block.  I laughed at that a long time!  And we have had more than a few politicians who  have had to ""return"" their PhD credentials after it was shown that they  plagerized (or at best ... made serious mistakes)  in thier Thesis."
Thomas Pliura,"In my opinion, and it's simply my opinion.....improperly using the title 'Dr.' ahead of one's name is a fraud....it's akin to a person claiming to have earned various military medals and honors, when they have not done so.....it would be better that person should use any of the following prefixes:Bamboozler,  Pilferer, Vagabond, Cheat, Gallavanter, Tramp, Thief, Dandy, Quockerwodger, Croakus, Pill-Pusher, Squirt, etc., etc.It is certainly possible people won't accept my opinion, so they'll likely need a second opinion....My second opinion is that the person might consider using a prefix, such as, ""The Cheat""Thomas J. Pliura, M.D.Le Roy, Illinois"
Jeff Parry,The WSJ columns and editorials over the last few years have slipped into a sort of supercilious rot that's just - frankly - embarrassing.   
A B,Huzzah!!!
David Gregory,"Wow. Does this guy have doctorate-envy or what?  A career academic who didn't have the right stuff to earn a Ph. D. himself.  It must have driven him crazy to hear others called ""doctor"" - others that he surely felt he was better than in his own twisted little mind. This article is the work of a loser.   WSJ is just trying to denigrate the future First Lady by publishing it. "
Valerie Gould,"@David GregoryBoy, did you hit that nail on the head!  The very same thoughts occurred to me as I read his blatant envious whining.  What surprised me is that with what he considers his outstanding education is that he is so unfamiliar Ph.Ds and Ed. Ds being called ""Doctor"".  I think he's just embarrassed by his ignorance. "
Colleen Kelly,New subscriber-The WSJ often has opionion pieces since FOX/Murdoch took over that are just Trumpian-ridiculous. They have one month to provide realistic and honest or real investigative -non partisan journalism--  and some quality balanced peices or I bail. The stocks are not enough and coloring the water with dirt is not enough either. 
J Kenzie,"Is it not interesting that this is even an issue worthy of a WSJ op-ed?  Mr. Epstein wrote that he spent 30-years as a teacher at Northwestern University, a quality university, so in 2020, he is now worrying about distinguishing between the Dr. MD/DO types and Dr. PhD types?

After 30-years at NU, it is surprising that he has not by now regulated the difference trivial and one that is commonly distinguishable by most folks?  In retrospect, did NU get their money's worth out of Mr. Epstein as a teacher?

If this is an ongoing obsession for Mr. Epstein perhaps he might engage in something more remedial, viewing The Big Bang Theory reruns come to mind.  They cover the doctor distinction incessantly.  Food for Mr. Epstein's thought?
"
CLARISSA ESTES,"Northwestern U issued a statement shortly after WSJ  pub'd epstein's opine.  It appears epstein overstated his importance and affiliation with NU in this article.  NU stated what the real situ was re epstein. It appears WSJ no longer cares about accuracy on its op ed page.  Subscribed to WSJ to follow trends, factual investigation, finances and world news. Not not worth their sky high subscription rate when their emphasis seems to be more and more on publishing diminishments like a tabloid. Come re-up time, have to choose a different source that is serious investigative, analyses etc.Too bad. It once was a  useful paper"
STATE CAPITOL,I don't know about anyone else but until I read this column I spent the whole election campaign thinking Dr. Jill Biden was some sort of physician.   A pediatrician maybe.  I feel like a chump.
James Muller,Or you could forgive yourself because you just didn't know that the title is not specific to a single field. Perfectly okay. Just like Dr. Biden's use of her earned title.
Christian Hoffmann,"Ever heard of Dr. Henry Kissinger ? Dr. Stephen Hawking ? Dr. Albert Einstein ? Or did you think they were all pediatricians, too ? "
STATE CAPITOL,"No, I've never heard of Dr. Stephen Hawking or Dr. Albert Einstein.  And I always thought of a Kissinger's Dr., though no doubt technically true, more as a calculated means of puffing plumage at tables of international diplomacy and negotiation where such titles seem to matter, especially to continental Europeans.  Slightly embarrassing but necessary. "
Daniel Berrones,Mr. Epstein's article is an opinion.  Why has the internet blown up in outrage over a goofy opinion?    
James Muller,Because free speech means being able to express yourself *and* take it on the chin when everyone else exercises their right to free speech and exclaims how little they think of your opinion.
Jane A. Massie,"Because women have been held to a different standard than men since time began.  Because the writer of that column is, essentially, accusing Dr. Biden of being ""uppity"".  "
Vincent O'Donnell,"I guess that other have pointed out that most medical practioners hold only a batchelor  degree, and addressing them as 'doctor' is a somewhat  acronistic  and deceptive courtesy. A bit like addressing ex-presidents as Mr President. A doctorate is supposed to reward an individual for making an unique contribution to knowledge in a specific field, while the MA is awarded for demonstration competence at higher research.  Unfortunately, PhDs are increasingly awarded for what is a t best a master's level achiebvement  , notably in the US.   Thus "" The Ph.D. may once have held prestige"".   I can assure the author in much of the world beyond the US borders  it still does."
John Weiner,"Just to follow up on the last post...of course Epstein is right and the hysterical backlash demonstrates once again what everybody knows...that the politically correct are fools, and you can NEVER argue with a fool."
John Weiner,"Epstein has finally written a provocative essay that has a certain University of Chicago look and feel.  I was a graduate student there a few years after Epstein, and EVERYBODY on the faculty was referred to as Mr. (or Miss or Mrs.) not Dr.  because it was naturally assumed that EVERYBODY had a Ph.D.  There was even a joke about some breathless undergraduate that insisted on calling his professor in class discussion Dr. so-and-so.  The prof. finally in exasperation hotly retorted, ""You may call your professors Dr. at South Dakota State Normal, but this is the University of Chicago!""."
Rosa Cumare,"Agreed, Mr. Weiner.  In my day as a graduate student at Harvard, only physicians and dentists (somewhat begrudgingly, but they were operating inside one's mouth, after all), were addressed as Dr.  We rolled our eyes at ""Dr."" Kissinger, joking that it was used for him because he was German.  And in the hierarchy of graduate school prestige, the ""Ed. School"" ranked dead last.  Academic snobbery? You betcha.  But even today I won't use ""Dr.""as my title, despite my Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language.  Maybe it's an Ivy League cultural trait."
Michael Welch,"Or maybe it is something that seems to be lacking today, class."
Loralei Barr,"Or maybe she is just proud of her accomplishment. If there is any snobbery here, it is you.  "
Keith Lakey,"Petty beyond human belief, and I am not talking about Dr. Biden.  It leaves one wondering whether, kiddo, you, like Fox News' Tucker Carlson, have trouble pronouncing Kamala Harris's name."
G Shiner,"This editorial is a real service.  Its prompted such a ridiculous, white-hot backlash, that everyday people are learning this lady isn't a real doctor and her insistence of that title is ridiculous.  She fooled a lot of people by using that title.  Mission accomplished."
Robert Block,"Did you only learn today that there are people called ""Doctor"" who don't carry around a stethoscope?"
Monique Giroux,"Read the article again my friend as you have not understood it.  Dr Biden never claimed to be a medical doctor (which is an MD), she claims to be a Dr (which indeed she is).   If you confused the two, it's an honest mistake on your part but not a reason for Dr Biden to belittle her accomplishments"
Valerie Gould,She only fooled those of you who were unaware that the title was used for more than doctors and dentists.  
ROBERT HAY,"Would the WSJ Opinion pages have the same response to referring to Dr. Henry Kissinger?  Oh, I need to remind myself that he is male and a Republican.  That apparently makes a huge amount of difference."
Roger Dunham,"Silly, Robert, the WSJ repeatedly refers to Henry Kissinger as Mr., for exactly the same reasons as the editorial.  You might want to research your opinion before writing again...."
ROBERT HAY,But did they write an op ed about the fact that he was often referred to as Dr. Henry Kissinger and that he should be referred to as kiddo?  And that his degree was useless?  You are missing the whole point.
Bill Straus,"Disappointing. A cursory glance at the professors at Northwestern confirms exactly what I expected, most go by Dr. in reference to their PHD. No surprise there, even though my college years are far past now, I distinctly remember my professors using this title though none were MDs. If Mr. Epstein is going to randomly ""call out"" Dr. Biden, maybe he should have started by antagonizing most of his colleagues first. But of course, why do that when he can simply hide behind a screen and undermine the accomplishments of a woman he doesn't know. For shame. "
John C,Another pompous Poor Hungry Doctor miffed they don't get the respect they think they deserve.
ROBERT HAY,Apparently you have not had the ability or the energy to accomplish that goal.
Evodio Tovar,"I agree with the professor from Northwestern. The prestige of earning a Ph.D. has seriously been deluded. Anyone can get it online now. Unless you are in medicine or the field of STEM, you shouldn't be called a doctor. An Ed.D isn't what it's cracked up to be.

 I have relatives that earn their Ph.D. in the field of medicine and STEM- much more education than Ed. D. I agree a doctorate in education is entirely different than a doctorate in medicine. Lawyers are doctors of jurisprudence, but we don't go around calling them Doctors.

If we went to the year 1150 when the first Ph.D. was awarded by the University of Paris, or to the early 1800s when American scholars earned a doctorate in Europe, even in the year 1847 when the AMA met to establish MD degree standards for US physicians.

The Ph.D. is the highest degree conferred by universities throughout the world. We should now reconsider that a Ph.D. should be for medical or STEM fields. "
ROBERT HAY,I certainly agree that online Ph.D. degrees are suspect.  But you should recognize that Jill Biden does not have an online degree so your comments are irrelevant.  And not all lawyers are doctors of jurisprudence.   And it is unfortunate that many of our citizens despise educators.  But we should respect the difficult work that people like Jill Biden do to attempt to improve the education of our citizens.
James Muller,"It's ""diluted,"" but please: feel free to continue whining about the watered down quality of present day doctorates.I'll also wager that grad students at Mr. Epstein's institution don't call him ""Mr. Epstein"" but nor do they likely call him ""Joseph"" either."
Shelly Stamps,"Just read the following on CNN - ""In response to a request for comment Sunday, Epstein, an author and essayist, told CNN in an email, ""No comment, apart from saying that I thought mine a lightly humorous piece, but I fear there isn't much humor in the world, especially among the politically correct.""""Lightly humorous? I discerned not one scintilla of humor. Oh, but bushels of disdain and sarcasm. You would do well to inform us at the beginning of the essay that this piece was humorous, so that we could get the joke.Even so, I'm not laughing. "
Miriam Blau,"Jeez, I cannot believe the negative reactions. I loved and agreed with every word of this piece.I'm related to a lot of PhDs, including one who was extremely important in her field, and none of them are pretentious enough to use the title ""Dr."""
Monique Giroux,"Why is it ""pretentious"" to be proud of your accomplishments? If you achieve something after putting in hours and hours of work, shouldn't you receive the honors that go with it? You are related to PhDs but have you ever tried to earn one yourself?  And when you say that your relatives do not use their titles, have you looked at their C.V., I'm pretty sure it's on it"
Dorab Sopariwala,"I write from faraway India where some politicians and other worthies tend to  buy honorary doctorates, often from third rate universities, and proudly display them on their letterheads.Consequently, I agree totally with Mr Epstein. Neither a Doctor of Philosophy nor a Doctor of Divinity - honorary or otherwise -  should attach the prefix Dr. to his name. Only one caveat:  Mr. Epstein is of a vintage that suggests that he must be familiar with Henry Kissinger in his prime. I wish he had written this Op Ed then about Dr (oops, sorry, Mr.) K, rather than at this Rip Van Winkelish moment when a lady with an Ed. D.  is about to become the FLOTUS."
ROBERT HAY,"Anyone who studies information theory knows that material that is highly predictable contains very little information.  Unfortunately, the opinion page(s) of the WSJ are very predictable -- all Republicans are wonderful and all Democrats are trash.  Strangely, the WSJ apparently believes that their typical readers agree with their useless and by their own admission highly biased trivia and actually have the time to waste reading it.  Much or the rest of the paper is useful but their opinion pages are useless garbage, only designed to help their conservative reader base feel good about their limited view of the world."
Edward Joback,"Spoken like a true elitist.Let me guess - you must have been tickled pink when she told you that she needed her own private server network because she liked the idea of carrying around a single device?Then you were relieved when James Comey said he would not prosecute for a plethora of counts for destroying subpoena evidence and violating the Espionage Act - all because he didn't find any ""intent"".  I'm sure it was beyond your curiosity to  inquire where exactly is the word ""intent"" used as exculpatory in said Espionage Act.?This led to that Russian dossier - of what we now know are lies - paid for the the same person implicated in the above.Which led to spying on the campaign of the opposing party; then, continuing this charade beyond the midterms, only ending when Robert Mueller proved himself a dithering old man clearly not the subject matter expert of the eponymous report.Just some facts - covered brilliantly in these pagesSo yes, as you've cited, Democrats are."
ROBERT HAY,Your response suggests that you have the level of intelligence that really appreciates the WSJ opinion pages.
Jeffry Brooks,"  My limited view is as good as yours, better in my opinion.  But feel good about your view.   The  NYT,  WP, LAT, SFC are highly predictable."
Ruth Kaufman,"Was Mr. Epstein's piece meant to be ""lighthearted""? If so, ick. It is offensive in so many ways. This is not about cancel culture - or is it just about canceling Jill Biden's academic credentials? - nor is it about political correctness. Did you REALLY think we wouldn't notice? In what way is ""Dr. Jill Biden'"" fraudulent? And how, exactly, is it comical for anyone to work hard to achieve a doctorate? Yes, the author's honorary degree is symbolic and not an indication of having ""earned"" said degree. Epstein's white male privilege alone positioned him to be on the receiving end of undeservedly being addressed as ""Doctor."" He is purposely misleading in his assessment as Jill Biden, unlike Epstein, actually did earn her doctoral degree. We're not in the 1950s anymore and, in case anyone missed it, women can wear many hats. Jill Biden can be First Lady without having to stow away her hard-earned doctoral degree. Get over it. "
Jay Lomer,I just subscribed to the WSJ - your piece made the $48 annual rate almost worth it!
M. Evans,This article alone was worth the subscription price!
Fred Douglas,"Thank you for a great and well needed editorial. Too many indeed do parade these ""qualifications"" and detract from those that have actual become real ""doctors"". One awarded as a designation of profession, the other simply more academic credential signalling. I know many with doctorate degrees;  let the ego-centric ones even attempt to have other refer to the as ""doctor"". Of course they are ignored (as appropriate). "
James Muller,"Many academics are far more colloquial, and do not regularly use their earned title. Why begrudge them that instead of complaining about the egocentric physicians who insist on being referred to by their equally earned title?Also, I invite you to do your own ""academic credential signaling"" before detracting from others. Seems like many commenting here who views doctorates as elitist lack one themselves, and rely on the anecdotal evidence of ""I know someone."""
Monique Giroux,"Sorry to break-in on your moment of self-satisfaction but Dr Biden's credentials are a designation of profession.  Also I didn't know there were ""ego-centric"" doctoral degrees, I think you meant to say, there are doctoral degrees that make you feel insecure"
Fred Douglas,"No, they are a designation of a certain level of achievement within academics. You don't need such a designation to be an educator. However, you do need to be designated a ""doctor"" to practice medicine. ""Ego-centric ones"" refers to ""them"" if you read carefully. I know many people with such educational (non medical) designations. None refer to themselves as ""Dr"" and they would be appropriately mocked if they did. Nope, no insecurity on my end.  However, do you need to see ""Dr"" to perhaps make your useless educational achievements seem important?"
Evodio Tovar,"I just subscribed to the WSJ. Thank you for your bravery, Good Sir!"
Monique Giroux,"Don't use the title Sir, it is elitist.  If you must address him by a title, try Kiddo, he seems to respond to that"
Martin Gargiulo,"Now that Mr. Epstein has helped Americans to focus on the real challenges facing the US in the next few years and on how to start addressing them, the rest of the world can relax!  The article may have a point in that using the ""Dr"" title is a bit preposterous. I do have a PhD from Columbia (and no, it was not as easy as Mr. Epstein suggests, although I don't recall the guy with the jug) and a respectable academic career, but I only use the ""Dr."" thing in Germany, because the ""herr Professor Doktor"" gives me some edge when dealing with bureacrats or with Lufthansa. In general, professors who use the ""Dr."" thing are those for whom whether they have or do not have  a PhD is by no means apparent. Whether singling out Ms. or Dr. Jill Biden for using it is worth an article in the WSJ, is another matter. I certainly do not think it does. "

Lisa Petras,"Are you TRYING to be a partisan hack? If that's what you're going for, BULLSEYE!"
Jeffrey Stone,"I see Trump and his misogynistic, childish name-calling practices have rubbed off on those who write op-ed pieces in the WSJ. You can bet I won't be forking out any $$ to read anything more from this irresponsible and hateful mouthpiece of the hateful right."
Edward Joback,"Let's stipulate all you've said about Trump's boorishness.How does that line up on your scale of deplorables when compared to running a massive pay for play scheme that enriches your family while selling out you and your country to its enemies in exchange for access?  (HINT:  To answer this question, you may chose to consider the Biden or the Clinton version).Or do you still believe those 50 former Intel hacks who wrote that memo saying Hunter Biden was being used as Russian disinformation?By all means, save your money.  And be sure to skip the Trump vaccine until Cuomo tells you that it's safe.  That way, you won't die from malignant hypocrisy."
Robert Suomi,"What a ridiculous article, how is it possible that such an article passed through the filter? If you have a PhD you are by definition a doctor. End of story."
Edward Joback,"Sure.  Right up there with the guy or gal scrubbing up for open heart surgery.How about the slip and fall lawyer you see advertising his services on daytime TV?A JD Juris Doctorate?At least law school required a 3 year investment and a qualifying, rigorous exam.Wanna bet how long it took ""Doctor"" Jill to write that thought provoking thesis of hers?"
James Muller,"""At least doctorate school required multiple years and a qualifying, rigorous dissertation.""The mental gymnastics employed by this article's esteemed author and those who agree with it's value defy belief."
Monique Giroux,"Yes I do want to bet.  How many years? Do you actually know? I don't think so.  So, how many years?"
David Lim,"I predict a very tough four years for the Biden administration in trying to get critical bills passed.  Partisanship will not stop and the Biden team just called for all out war. So be it.  Northwestern University use to be a good university, but after the ""cancel"" culture, they just became second tier."
Lisa Fracica,"I disagree with the author's contention that Dr. Biden's doctoral thesis topic is unpromising. As a psychotherapist, I have seen many clients with a recent or remote history of attending ""some college"" followed by dropping out. In all cases mental health issues were the cause of their inability to complete college. Also, published research has shown that students who leave or drop out of college includes a substantial number in need of mental health services. This is a group that colleges need to spend time monitoring for, screening for mental health issues, and referring to counseling services if needed. In addition, the stresses of the 2020 political conflicts in the US along with the pandemic, have led to an increased demand for mental health services. College students are most likely more stressed this year than usual, with some developing mental health challenges as a result. Therefore, the issue of student retention in colleges written about by Dr. Biden remains an important one.

Judy Neuwirth,"In an absolutely disgusting display of political correctness, Northwestern University has taken action in response to this very article. According to the New York Post:""Northwestern University wiped one of its former lecturers from the school's website after he penned a controversial Wall Street Journal editorial arguing First Lady-elect Jill Biden shouldn't use the title of ""Dr."" before her name. Joseph Epstein had been listed as an ""emeritus lecturer of English"" on the school's website earlier Saturday, but the page had vanished later in the day.""Dear Editorial Board, please stand strong against the tide of Cancel Culture and leave this article in place! Those that see the article as anything other than a little bit of humor are just plain silly. Do not listen to them. "
James Muller,"If the editorial board took a stand against cancel culture, they would remove this article for trying to cancel Dr. Biden's use of her earned title."
Monique Giroux,"I'm glad you are laughing and yes, I will be cancelling my subscription to the WSJ because anyone can talk garbage but I don't have to pay for it.  Right?"
JANE ANTLEY,"I am surprised that so many commenters are incensed by this lighthearted enjoyable essay by Joeph Epstein.  Are so many people just addicted to ""outrage?""  It boggles the mind, and is worrisome, for sure.  Please, take deep breaths and perhaps don't read funny pieces that give you the terrors!"
Jeffrey Stone,"Always funny when you aren't the focus of such childish hatefulness, yeah. I guess we should also dress in blackface or run around with feather bonnets as well? Shameful!"
Jeffry Brooks,"   What's wrong with feather bonnets?    I dressed as a pirate one Halloween, greatcoat, eye patch, beard, tricorn hat, brass cane shoved through my belt as my side arm...people treated me coldly...I guess I was insulting Pirates,  appropriating their culture."
Andre Rashish,"This wasn't meant to be lighthearted. His point is that Dr. Biden should satisfied with the job conferred on her by her husband's job instead of having her own identity, which includes a doctorate. It's not the 1950s anymore. I suppose your ideal first lady would be someone for whom this isn't a problem, like Melania, since she has no accomplishments. "
William Kostrzewa,"Mr Epstein's comments on the perceived lack of rigor regarding Doctorate degrees may or may not be true. I really can't say for sure. Most of the responses I've read don't seem to address his main point which seems to be that PHD designations, at least for many disciplines, don't demand as much as they used to. Most of the responses just attack the author for claiming this.One thing for sure regarding the education/indoctrination that goes on at so many colleges these days is this: it's WAYYYYYY too expensive."
Tanya Sanchez,How would he even know about the rigor?  He didn't even earn a Masters degree.  
Heleno Pioner,This article is absolutely appalling. The notion that only physicians have the prerogative to use the title Dr is simply false. Everyone that earns a PhD can use the title Dr at its discretion. It's a shame that the WSJ allows an article like this to be published.
Paul Charlton,"Thanks Heleno. I wonder if the less-than-learned author knows what the Ph stands for in PhD? Clearly not. Psst everyone. It stands for ""Philosophy"". Nothing to do with medicine. Doctor /= Medicine."
Andre Rashish,"And ""doctor"" comes from the Latin, docere, ""to teach."" Maybe he didn't get to learn that while struggling to get his only degree, a BA."

Jeffry Brooks,"   Well that's your opinion.   We know better.  Btw, why is Trump your ""Dear Leader"" ?"
Jeffrey Stone,Says the group who lost their mind and started pushing nonsense conspiracy theories about stolen elections when their sacred cow lost the election.
Monique Giroux,and wait until Trump goes to jail. Woo HOOO
Lois Leftwich,"This is a ludicrous article and I'm disappointed that the WSJ wasted the space it took to run it. I subscribed in order to have a more rounded picture of American politics, The Washington Post is my go-to publication. I love Peggy Noonan and Joanna Stern, but this bozo is enough to make me quit my subscription. Dr. Jill Biden deserves her title and shouldn't have to give it up. I'm proud to have her as a First Lady and as a person she brings integrity and scholarship to the White House. "
Fred Douglas,"When you say WaPo is my ""go-to"", you need not say more. What should be dubbed the ""Victim Post"", they truest can find ""I'm so offended"" everywhere these days. "

Christopher Moehle,"This article is a complete waste of space, and the WSJ should apologize for publishing it.  The WSJ used to be a reputable, center right news source.

DENISE CARLSON,Just cancelled my subscription.  Looking forward to the amazing Dr. Jill Biden serving as our First Ladyand also to forgetting the porn past of the current first (or is it third) lady.
SUSAN HERBST,So what makes Jill so amazing?
Chak Foon Tso,"Whether or not a doctorate degree holder choose to use it as his/her title is entirely at his/her own discretion. As a PhD holder, I say Dr. Biden like me can ask to be addressed as Dr.  WHENEVER she wants. ""Dropping the Doc""  is especially problematic when this notion is targeted against a woman, somehow saying she is not worthy of her accomplishment; and for Dr. Biden case it is somehow implying Mrs or other female titles are acceptable for the first lady. WSJ needs to retract this piece or I will seriously reconsider my subscription. "
SUSAN HERBST,"Wow, please do it!  I don't want to read your comments anymore.  I hope more follow you."
Jeffry Brooks,"   I don't know what this is about,  Seems pointless to pick on individuals, about titles their degrees and  media grants them."
Irving Levinson,"Mr. Epstein's comments rest on a false assumption: that the rigids requirements for a  Ph.D.  degree no longer exist.  But at many universities, they still do. These include not only the knowledge of two foreign languages, but comprehensive examinations lasting two days and, of course, the dissertation. These degrees are rather like currencies. There are academic equivalents of the Swiss franc and academic equivalents of the Zimbabwean dollar. The fact that one such currency is of far greater value than the other is no reason for disposing of all of them."
Warren Hall,"I'm no fan of Biden.  His wife is a PhD and a very high % of people with PhD's use the title ""Doctor"".  

Come on man, we are bigger than that."
Ryan Mahoney,She doesn't have a Ph.D. Couldn't make it through the article before rushing down to comment? 
Evan Roden,"She has a doctorate in Education, which is absolutely enough to use the title ""doctor"""
Paul Thiry,Really? She doesn't have a PhD? Site your sources. 
James Muller,"I'm in favor of her use of the Dr title, but no, she does not have a PhD -- she has an Ed.D."
Valerie Ross,An Ed.D. is a doctor of education.   A Ph.D. is a doctor of philosophy.  An M.D. is a doctor of medicine.  They're all doctors.   
FokYan Leung,"Mr. Epstein betrays not only his pettiness and insecurity, but also his ignorance.  In the field of educational research, the title ""Dr."" is typically used, and on articles, the authors' terminal degrees is also listed,. This is done because not all educational researchers have a PhD or PhD equivalent.  So Dr. Jill Biden's use of the honorific is not only earned, but it is standard practice within her field of study.  I do not use my ""Dr."" honorific, but I fully support Dr. Jill Biden's use.  She both earned the degree, unlike MR. Epstein, and it is standard practice within her field.  Either would be sufficent. - FY L, PhD. Caltech, 2003"
Stephen Beck,This is the dumbest thing I have ever read in the WSJ.  Completely unnecessary.
James Mackenzie,"This is my feeling as well. In the great scheme of things, it's a  fairly trivial issue but really, why? Epstein is a nobody, his opinion doesn't matter. All this kind of article does is add another drop of poison to the well. What's the point of publishing it?"
Bob Sanderson,"Merriam -WebsterWhat to Know
Doctor comes from the Latin word for ""teacher"" and originally referred to a small group of theologians who had approval from the Church to speak on religious matters. Eventually the term saw greater use referring to qualified academic and medical professionals."
BARRY MILLER,Is this a tempest in a teapot?  Could any PhDs respond?
Mike Smith,"Yes.  I tended to call myself 'Dr. Smith' only as a joke (those under 65 look up the TV series"" Lost in Space""), but there is no reason to think a Doctor of Philosophy is inferior to a Doctor of Medicine - especially when, as in my case, it is actually a doctorate in philosophy. We were the original doctors.But it is not a live dispute deserving inches of ink in the WSJ."
Rabi I.,"Mr Epstein,Dr. Jill Biden (yes, Dr.) earned her Ed.D and should not be belittled by anyone, especially someone with ""only a B.A. in absentia"". Dr. Biden is an inspiration for men and women everyone, to keep learning and gaining knowledge, and use it for good. Use of the title is a matter of choice.Interestingly, in the United Kingdom (UK), students go through medical school and become 'Dr', but when they later become surgeons, they revert to Mr/Ms/Mrs/Miss, etc.It seems to me there is some bitterness and envy/ jealousy here, not having earned an academic doctorate yourself. Not too late to try you know, you just have to humble yourself a little. And get over yourself. "
Nicholas Fournier,"While senility is a sad demise, it's a pity that the WSJ allows itself to slide into the role of Murdoch propaganda machine as Fox wavers."
Thomas Pedron,"Bottom line up front: I am unsubscribing and have convinced two of my neighbors to do likewise. There's allowing opinions and elevating outdated viewpoints. Part of editorial control is having the foresight to make that decision. Maybe the WSJ is falling victim to the click-bait emotional-response-to-drive-viewership model.  Either way, I can only protest the decision to elevate such a dangerous viewpoint by my own personal decision to cancel my membership. "
Eliza Mia,"Bye, bye.  We will miss you.  Who gives a hoot.  "
Mark Moran,"I may be not far behind you. I subscribed to the WSJ Digital Edition within minutes of it becoming available a decade or more ago. The quality of the publication is in a free fall, as this piece evidences. I used to be inspired by the editorial page; now I am sickened. "
Eliza Mia,Adi 0s to you too.  
M. Evans,toodles
ELIZABETH JOYCE,I get it.   Biden beat Trump so attack Biden's family. 
Eliza Mia,"that's it!!  eureka, dr. joyce? "
M. Evans,I get it. Trump beat Clinton so attack Trump's family.
Linda Rosin,"With of all of the words in the English language, you chose 'kiddo'  ?   It immediately gave me flashbacks to  1983 when I had a boss that used that term with all of the women in the organization."
M. Evans,as opposed to dog-faced pony soldier?
Andre Rashish,"""Kiddo"" is such a dismissive, infantilizing word. Epstein knew what he was doing. I can't quite imagine him calling Dr. Henry Kissinger ""kiddo"" and mocking him for using ""Dr."""
Stephen Higgs,"I already unsubscribed to WSJ earlier this month (effective in a week or two) due to the longstanding substandard quality of the editorial page, both the columnists and the editorial positions paper itself. If it was mathematically possible to unsubscribe twice I'd do it.  ; ) I've switched to Financial Times and that is an outstanding publication, with a much greater global circulation than the WSJ-there's a reason for that-the Financial Times is a class act, and the WSJ editorial page is too often the next chapter of a long-running clown show. This is not about politics, it's about quality. Folks, if you can only take so much of this kind of degraded journalism, talk with your feet and your wallet. "
Mike Smith,"The editorial pages have been a dumpster fire for decades If something like that matters to you, why did you subscribe in the first place?  Vermont Royster hasn't been at the helm for half a century. "
Dapo F,Thank you for suggesting the financial times. 
Trent King,"At my home town high school, Univ. Of Delaware was considered a safety school if you couldn't make Rutgers."
Evan Roden,"Cool, Trent. Does the fact that U of D is a safety school for BA and BS level degrees matter at all to the quality not their doctoral program?"
Eliza Mia,I agree.  Drop the Dr and use Mrs. Wife of a senile serial plagiarizer instead. 
Tia Sawhney,"Mr. Epstein stunningly addresses Dr. Jill Biden , a woman approaching 70 years old, as ""kiddo"" and suggests that ""Lady"", ""Madame"", and ""Mrs."" are the highest titles that she is entitled to hold -- titles derived exclusively from her relationship with President-Elect Biden.  He suggests that while some people who earned their doctorates in decades-gone-by may deserve the title doctor, she, a respected educator who earned her degree 15 years ago, does not.  He then spends the next three paragraphs implying that her degree is on par with an honorary doctorate.  My outrage is not that such ignorant misogynists exist, it's that the WSJ chose to give Mr. Epstein a national stage and then, today, defended him.  So, Dr. Tia Goss Sawhney, who obtained her doctorate of public health (DrPH) in 2012 at the age of 47 is unsubscribing from the WSJ.  You are not worthy of my money."
Eliza Mia,"Adios, Dr. Sawhney... oh, wait no adi 0s Tia. "
Paul Thiry,"Hey Eliza, what are your qualifications? Just curious why you think it is appropriate to tear another woman down for educating herself?"
JACK GARDEN,"The WSJ should be ashamed. How can someone who hasn't bothered to go through the process of earning a Ph.D. criticize another individual for proudly wearing the title of Dr. with her name? Not to mention the misogyny baked into each condescending and belittling word. Isn't the WSJ supposed to edit and ostensibly read through a piece before publishing, even a lowly op-ed? Mr. Epstein, kiddo: a bit of advice. Try putting any hard work in before criticizing any woman who happens to be smarter and superior to you in academic rank.  Your need to compensate for many failures in life is showing, and it is honestly sad. "
Monique Giroux,"What a pitiful excuse Paul A Gigot, the Editor of WSJ,  gave to the NY Times about this article. He is playing the politics card you see.  If you disagree with him,  you are playing the race or gender card.  An awful lot of card playing happens at WSJ.  But not a lot of  good journalism unfortunately."
Eliza Mia,I agree.  Drop the Dr and use Mrs. Wife of a senile plagiarizer instead.  
Steve Borst,"Please provide the credentials that enable you to make such a statement.Right. I thought not.Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Eliza Mia,Titles don't impress me.  
Amanda Woody,"That's because you will never have one. You will never understand the hard work that goes into obtaining one.Amanda, MPH"
Eliza Mia,I may not have one but I don't need to impress anyone with a fake Dr title either.  MPH -  Married Phone y Ho e 
Steve Borst,Wow. Impressive.
Elizabeth Bear,"4. He seems to believe that it is self evident that the University of Delaware is sub par - on what basis he does not say.5. He seems to have been unable to reason from common sense that a student married to the Senator of  Delaware, who is herself working as a teacher in Delaware, may logically pursue her advance degree in Delaware.  I mean moving to New Haven or Cambridge MA to do so would be ridiculous - that does seem self evident.6. As to the topic of her dissertation, it is quite relevant on top of being useful, more so one could argue than the 2000th dissertation on Chaucer.7. At least it certainly is no less rigorous or important than another view on Chaucer or the Napoleonic wars.8. As to MDs or scientists - some practice badly, failed to really learn, as there are poor dissertations done in science - of course!9. The author has no point at all, save a desperate need to gain attention by using Jill Biden's name as the headline of his drivel."
Jeffry Brooks,   Seems like something designed to attract people to shoot it down.  I don't know anyone with issues like this :)
Steven Daniel,"""In September 1970, Harper's Magazine published an article by Epstein called ""Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity""[9] that used the N-word to describe being gay and was criticized for its perceived homophobia.[10] Epstein wrote that he considered homosexuality ""a curse, in a literal sense"" and that his sons could do nothing to make him sadder than ""if any of them were to become homosexual.""[10][11]""It would appear you haven't grown much since 1970. Mr. Epstein. Still a homophobe as well as a snob?"
Jeffry Brooks,"       Well, it is a curse."
Evan Roden,"How so? They have live full lives and most Christian churches agree they can still be married without sin. It doesn't impact them in any way, and the only way it's a ""curse"" to be gay is the struggle to find acceptance in a world with hate."
Daniel Harlow,"It is a disgrace that the Wall Street Journal published this misogynistic drivel.  This guy is clearly just feeling emasculated that our new first lady is better educated than he is, which is 100% his problem and 0% her problem (or our problem).  Kudos to Professor Biden for continuing her important work!"
Steve Borst,"AmenJennifer, PhD 1999"
Ted Goris,Another great article Dr. Epstein. Highlight of my weekend.   I've heard it said that 25% of the people have no sense of humor.  I think that number may be low judging from the reaction to your article.  The stuffed shirts are coming out of the woodwork and I'm seeing more than a little sawdust.  Ah democracy.(Democracy...  it is the hole in the stuffed shirt through which the sawdust slowly trickles.  E. B White)
Steve Borst,"Right said Ted. How is it that you could be more appalling than the original article. Yet you achieved that.Dr. Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Eliza Mia,My sister has a doctorate of pharmacy but she doesn't ever go by Dr. ... 
Amanda Woody,"That's her decision. You get that, right? That she has made the decision not use the term versus someone telling her she cannot or shouldn't use ther term. Dr. Biden has earned the right, same as your sister has to make that determination. Amanda, MPH"
Eliza Mia,"Even if she wanted us to call her Dr, I wouldn't call Dr.  She isn't a medical doctor.  MPH ?  Married Phone y Ho e"
Andre Rashish,"Eliza Mia the word ""doctor"" comes from the Latin docere, to teach. What does that even have to do with medicine? MD simply specified what kind of doctor: medical. And MPH stands for masters of public health, not whatever odd amalgam of letters and spacing you've contrived."
JOHN GARDINER,"An Ed.D. is a Doctorate in Education, so she is entitled to being called Dr. Biden.  End of story."
LYNN RICHARDSON,"To earn a PhD is a noteworthy accomplishment which one should be proud of and honored for.  Why would she drop the title?  She earned it.WSJ, please, try and become more even handed.  Don't become the other side of the New York Times.  "
Dan R,"Lynn, she does not have a PhD.  There is a huge difference between Ed.D. and PhD as noted many times today.  Also, if WSJ were to become the other side of NY Times, then they would censor or hold back comments from those that dissent, which they never do.  Keep up the great work WSJ!"
Steve Borst,"There is not a huge difference between EdD and PhD. Could you please provide us your credentials so that we can respect your ""opinion"" on this point?Yeah, I thought not.Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Evan Roden,"Dan, you're mistaken. The process to obtain a Doctorate in Education is difficult and requires great effort. She earned the title."
Elizabeth Bear,"The author a self proclaimed educator (professor) demonstrates his own  failure to obtain the most basic fruits of education - how to reason, compose an argument, make a point, analyze something, write, comment or critique, think -  himself by the following:
1. Citing a quote in support of his argument that absolutely refutes it. Babies are delivered by all sorts of folk, and arrived prior to Drs existing of course.2. He devotes the piece to another topic entirely - honorary degrees - apples and oranges don't work when you make a statement about apples and go ahead and disparage oranges.3. Where he does discuss actual doctorates - his criteria for rigor is not the content of the dissertation, but the level of misery required in defending it."
WAH Holloway,I thought she was a medical Dr.Will probably continue to think thatEOS
Steve Borst,"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that she's not a M.D. How long have these people been in the public eye? Your misunderstanding is your fault.Nevertheless, her advanced degree gives her every right to call herself ""Dr.""- Dr Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Sheryl Miller,"How could any writer for a serious paper say such a stupid thing; a person who knows nothing about a doctorate and where the language comes from.  More and more, the Wall Street Journal has become a source of misinformation.  A doctor of philosophy came long before a doctorate of medicine.  Only the seriously uneducated would think the M.D. (doctorate of Medicine) captures the notion of doctor better than Ed.D. (doctorate of Education) or Ph.D. (Doctorate of Philosophy).  This make it hard to accept WSJ as a serious publication.  One must seriously question the education and or intelligence of an editorial board who would accept such an absurdity."
WAH Holloway,Cancel seems necessary 
Paul Bremner,"Well, I learned something today.  Jill Biden is actually not a medical doctor. I have to agree it's a tad misleading for people with Ph.D's to use the honorific ""Dr."" (unless, maybe,  it's in a hard science.)   I have three master's degrees, two from top ten universities.  The third is from a degree program ranked 25th.I got admitted, then turned down a Ph.D program, (at MIT) because I thought it would slow me down.  They don't have an honorific for someone with three master's degrees.  Oh, well. (Even if I had a Ph.D, I'd never allow anyone to call me by that.)On the other hand, as you can tell, I have great respect for higher learning institutions and people who pursue advanced learning.Doesn't Epstein have anything better to do than display what is obviously his own insecure case of  ""educational envy?"""
Elizabeth Bear,"There is talk that this piece is sexist, and while it is, that is not the most disturbing thing about it, by far.This piece is phenomenally ironic.Here is an educator who also claims to be educated, who can not compose a coherent much less cogent argument.The man can not write nor reason.The man never learned the one thing education teaches those who learn - to think."
WAH Holloway,ReadyFireAim
Steve Borst,"And the man said, kiddo.To someone who is his superior.That ended the conversation for me.-Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Dapo F,EXACTLY!!
Michael Beverly,Once again the WSJ publishes the opinion of someone without any expertise in the area they are writing about.  
WAH Holloway,Mad Magazine comes to mind
Beverly Klemme,"I have a PhD in physics, happen to be female, and very rarely put ""Dr."" in front of my name or ""PhD"" after it. However I respect anyone's choice to do so, knowing how difficult it is to get a doctorate in any field. However, I thinks it's ridiculous to describe this as some kind of sexist attack. Lighten up people!Beverly"
WAH Holloway,You tell em Dr.
JANE ANTLEY,"Exactly!  Thanks, Beverly!"
Steve Borst,"Oh it is an attack.Beverly, tell me how you escaped grad school and postgrad work without enduring a  unwanted advances from men in the field. You will be in the minority.-Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Jeffry Brooks,"  I had plenty of unwanted advances from women, when not single. I do like women, though,  and was both flattered & gentle saying no.BTW, congratulations  Dr. Jennifer.    "
"ROBERT C. STOREY, JR.","Yes, it is chauvinistic to criticize a woman for doing what she is entitled to do in accordance with legal and social norms.
But let's go a little deeper. What this really is is name calling, a la Donald Trump. It is like Trump calling her husband, ""Sleepy Joe"". The clear intent here is to minimize the effectiveness of the First Lady in her new roll. To make her not a serious player.
I suppose people in politics must grow thick skins.
But a newspaper opinion piece is not the place for this sort of thing.The election is over. Stick to the news.Shame on the WSJ."
Richard Dinkins,"Uh, I think that's why it's called the Opinion page and not the News page.  "
Jeffry Brooks,"  ""Sleepy Joe"" Jill Biden?  That's why Trump was elected.  Look at the never ending misery Democrats put him and the nation through.   It took a very tough thick skinned type of guy to stand up to the endless character and personal abuse, and that was Trump."
Norman Spier,"The meaning of a doctorate these days is a fair question, and one  I  ask myself a lot, as I try to find good ""social epistemological"" sources for the information and analysis that I so badly need to be a responsible citizen in a democracy.I've decided: Ph.D. in physics or pure math is almost uniformly sound, with a person able to translate their analysis / syntheses / determination of what is known vs. what is only a guess into other areas, including policy.Ph.D. in some math-related disciplines,  not always so. Other disciplines: often Ph.D.'s produce poor analyses.The only thing I have to add is that another credential I find weak, with people overestimating themselves, is ""major newspaper editor"".I've a tried a subscription to the WSJ looking to see if there is sharp and detailed enough analysis, and the answer is no.There is sloppiness in conclusions, inadequate analytical detail, ideology replacing thought, and it's not helping me much with my needs for the democracy."
WAH Holloway,If only you had visited these pages prior to your purchase 
Norman Spier,"Aah.  I just started a month ago, on the $4. a month trial.  So I'm not out a lot of money.  The trial rate runs for up to a year.  I'll be out by then, before it goes to $40. a month, because there's simply not enough value.I tried the WSJ subscription finding problems with my usual NY Times and Washington Post for those needs to try and meet the information demands of a democracy, which are ultimately beyond us all, but I try to do the best I can.I do appreciate that the WSJ avoids overly opinionated headlines like ""Trump Attempts to Undermine Democracy"".  But there's just not much good analysis and synthesis, which involves a lot of details.Like the Times and Post, everything is done as a short ""story"".  In both cases, the needs of the bulk of the audience may be met.  But mine are not met.(I will still hold the Times and Post, as basic sources.  There is bias, particularly at the Times, but I can figure out myself when that is happening, and compensate.)"
Steve Borst,You have decided? Oh thank you so much for your mansplaining. Please provide your credentials so that we can evaluate how valid your mansplaining decisions are.
Steve Borst,"Sincerely,Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Norman Spier,"You were confusing me with the ""Steve Borst"" account with the word ""mansplaining"".I see you must be Jennifer, a female, with a 1999 Ph.D.I have a mathematical statistics Ph.D. from 1988.  And I'm far less than a genius.My observations are from talking to mathematicians and physicists and others over the years, doctorates in various disciplines, and no doctorate.Almost uniformly, there is a ring of the correct and reasonable understanding of the problem, physics, math, or jumping over to policy.--which I tend to like to talk about and steer the conversation to.This does not imply, and I did not mean to imply, that other people don't often analyze the problem just as well.  But I find it far less a guarantee with some of the other disciplines.(It is important to me because I feel a problem in a democracy is that some people come up with really bad solutions to problems.  Often this is due to a person not ""knowing what they don't know"".)What is your opinion on the issue?"
Steve Borst,"Yes I am Jennifer, a PhD. Why does it make a difference? I'm sorry you are confused, but that is not my problem."
Ergun Uc,"Anybody who has earned a doctorate degree is entitled to be called Dr. There are different kind of doctors, not only just medical doctors. All of them are  typically earned after 4 years or more graduate education.  I am a medical doctor and work  with many other colleagues who have PhD or PsyD or ScD or EdD in an academic environment, where it is very natural to call these colleagues as Dr also.  All these people worked very hard to obtain their graduate degrees. If the author had earned a doctorate degree himself through such a long education and effort, his views on this subject might have been different.This article is about a non-issue unless it is written to score a political point on a non-political issue. It is a little below the level of the opinion pieces that I am used to read and enjoy in the WSJ."
WAH Holloway,Says a member of the Doctor Club
Steve Borst,"When you earn your doctorate, Mr. Epstein, we can talk.Jennifer, PhD 1999"
WAH Holloway,Most PhD's I know maintain an open mind and are ready to engage without prerequisites and such and whatnot
Michael Smith,This is pathetic and shameful for the WSJ.
WAH Holloway,And More!lets demonstrate and picket
Wendy Keller,"Considering the ""pedigree"" of our current FLOTUS complete with nude photos, one would think you would have more respect for the incredible achievements of our new FLOTUS.  Furthermore, denigrating her accomplishment (at 55 no less), solely because in your estimation, the achievement is diminished as it didn't hold the rigor of ""terror"", is just misplaced anger. One wonders?  What is really making you so angry?"
Daniel Sims,Melania was a successful model in U S.  and Europe.  Who cares if a model was nude in a photograph? You are  disrespectful to successful models in an extremely competitive industry.
Francesca Hudson,"The field you reference is called ""porn"" and requires no education whatsoever."
WAH Holloway,Awesome!but equally sexist Wendy
Steven Daniel,"Too lazy to go to grad school after your service was complete Mr. Epstein? After all, you had the G. I. bill to help underwrite the cost so money wasn't the issue. Or were you not able to get into a graduate program even at the Masters level?Just curious.Dr. Steven Daniel"
WAH Holloway,Awesome Dr.You got right to the pointWell done 
Francesca Hudson,"This op-ed only betrays the ignorance - and apparent envy - of its author.  Truly educated persons understand that the title 'doctor' is intended for scholars and not physicians.  A physician after all is someone trained in the practice of medicine, just another one of the skilled trades."
WAH Holloway,Hip Hip HoorayFinally
Albert Alpha,Mr. Epstein seems to be singing his own praise by belittling someone else. Not impressed.
WAH Holloway,AmazingCool name!
Mikael Ahlgren,"What a mess! Watch out Breitbart, the WSJ is coming for you. Mr. Epstein, you obviously didn't receive your honorary doctorate in logic.  Dr. Biden did not receive an honorary doctorate and neither you nor I have any means of validating the rigor of Dr. Biden's program. When you finish congratulating yourself for your false modesty, perhaps you should take some classes."
WAH Holloway,Online?Or correspondence?
Morrie Cook,"Someone told me that a wise man once said,  ""All wise men are not truly wise.""  Someone else said, ""A man with an opinion and a large platform is, well, just a man with an opinion and a large platform."" Often times it is better to let a spurious opinion dissipate into the darkness where it belongs than to provide the oxygen and light for a specious point of view to gain exposure."
Meryl K,"This is beyond insulting. Dr. is the title of a teacher. It's both presumptuous and incredibly illiterate of him to write something like this without recognition of the etymology (which in one of its basic definitions means ""the origin of a word and the historical development of its meaning""). Calling anyone who has putt in the time, sweat, dedication, and effort to get a doctorate - and who is older than him - ""kiddo"" is belittling and insulting. He would never do this to a man. I will add that I am a woman with a PhD and I take issue with the publishing of a piece like this in the pages of the WSJ."
WAH Holloway,Issue taken and well noted Dr.!
Rabi I.,"Dr. Biden is not older than Mr. Epstein, but that's beside the point."
Jason Chimienti,"Cheers to Mr. Epstein, B.A. for ""speaking"" his incisive mind in spite of being  bullied by the current zeitgeist. He is spot on. For an  Ed. D. to share the same title as an MD is a complete joke. Woman or man."
Isaac Reitberger,"The term Doctor means teacher in Latin and dates back to the Middle Ages.  The MD was originally a three-year undergraduate degree in the 19th century, so I guess you can say it's the new kid on the block. A simple search of Wikipedia would have taught you a few things. "
Steve Borst,"Mmmm, delicious Isaac.Jennifer, PhD 1999"
Steve Borst,"Please share your credentials with us so that we can judge you as you have judged Dr. Jill Biden.Jennifer, PhD 1999 (Human Genetics)"
WAH Holloway,Awesome but your account name is not in syncis it?Is Steve a Dr. or not?
Steve Borst,"WAHHHSteve is my husband. We share this account to read the WSJ.And Why would it matter?Jennifer, PhD Human Genetics 1999"
JANE ANTLEY,Preach!  I agree 100%!  The outrage is Much Ado About Nothing!
Vanissa Thurman,"Melania Trump was a plagiarist, a resume inflator, and her professional modeling pictures had to be subjected to catch and kill by the National Enquirer, so she could be reputation sanitized enough to be called the first lady.  Now you take issue with a woman who earned a Ph.D. from a reputable university at the tender age of 55, still wants to teach, and cares enough about going where the need is greatest that she spent eight years teaching at a community college when she most certainly could have spent her professional capital, and boosted her education resume, by teaching at an Ivy League school around the nation's capital. I am proud of Jill Biden. Prouder still to call her a college at Northern Virginia Community College.  Every other semester I have to deal with a student that brags about haven gotten out of high school without ever reading a book. I will show them your article. With your argument, they can claim you as one of their own.  "
Dan R,"Vanissa, for the hundredth time today Jill Biden does not have a PhD.  Please read the article and other comments."
John Riley,"Yes, she does. She has a Doctorate of Education. What are you confused about?"
Steve Borst,"Dan R, for the hundredth time today, please let us know how you are qualified to criticize Dr. Jill Biden. Academic credentials? Go for it!"
Steve Borst,Waiting for a good laugh here.
Jeffrey Fisher,"Any chance someone hit the Covid home-bar a little early and a little heavy before drafting a catastrophic missive and hitting send? Dr. Biden seems to have earned and used her accreditation entirely respectably. People I know and love and respect, and who help our community in countless ways, have invested significant portions of their lives to become a Doctor of Chiropractic, or Education, or Philosophy, or many other variants.  Most but not all of these areas of study existed centuries or millennia before the western world created an MD degree.  I  enjoy the pleasure and privilege of serving as a lecturer in the college of business at a phenomenal university.  Tier 1 research; top 5 in the US, diversity-wise; #1 university for US veterans.  Barely scratching the list here.  And who makes it great?  Me as a part time lecturer, sure, but mostly all my colleagues who've dedicated their lives and careers to our students.  All those PhD's and so on.  All those Doctors.  "
Steve Borst,"BravoJennifer, PhD 1999 (Human Genetics)"
WAH Holloway,Who is Steve then?A genome?Another Dr.?
Steve Borst,"Oh my you must think you are funny.Steve is my husband. We share this account to read WSJ.Sorry to disappoint you, no Deep State conspiracies here. Jennifer, PhD 1999 (Human Genetics)"
Ladan Mohaddes,As a woman ( holding a PhD degree) this is by far the most sexist article I have read on WSJ since I subscribed! 
Steve Borst,"YesJennifer, PhD 1999(Human Genetics)"
WAH Holloway,List 4 others please so I can avoid them
Nancy Jimeno,"I am ashamed to admit that this article stung. My Ph.D. turned out to be a waste of time with regard to my employment (I am an adjunct at a state university and make less than my waitress daughter). But I did work hard for it and the qualifying exams and dissertation defense were grueling, as was getting published. "
Steve Borst,"AmenJennifer, PhD 1999"
JOSEPH S VONKAENEL,"Like many others, when I first heard Jill Biden referred to as Doctor, i assumed she was a medical doctor. I took comfort in the  possibility that as a medical professional she could deal with her  husband's cognitive challenges, signs of dementia and increasing gaffes.  Nonetheless, I am sure that her PhD dissertation  about community colleges is every bit as groundbreaking, insightful and cutting edge as Michele Obama's senior dissertation at Princeton which I have read. I urge everyone to read both documents and compare the two.  "
Steve Borst,"First, let's read yours. Care to share?"
jennifer raineri,Indeed.  I too thought she was a medical doctor.  I also thought it would be helpful to Joe.
Victoria Baumfield,"I too have written an undergraduate thesis at an Ivy League school as well as a PhD thesis (in law).  You are obviously being sarcastic, but as someone with clearly more experience in this area than you, there is  no chance that even the best undergrad thesis would compare with a doctoral thesis.  Sorry.  Anyway, community colleges are playing an increasingly important role in society, in particular as college tuition spirals out of control and in light of the increasing income inequality in the US.  By mocking Dr Biden's choice of dissertation topic, you are merely showing your own ignorance, Joseph."
JANE ANTLEY,"Hilarious, and I agree!"
Vincent Nicolosi,"Is it really possible that this  Joseph Epstein is the same  Joseph Epstein whose essays I have admired and taught in literature classes?! Impossible. I refuse to believe it. Apparently an imposter passing himself off as the real  Joseph Epstein. I mean, it's just plain not smart. The writer of this really does not know that people with a doctorate are, as with physicians, referred to as Doctor?  Joseph Epstein never knew that? Try reading some Dr. Samuel Johnson. Good reading helps up the intelligence level.And why is the WSJ publishing this stuff?"
Lawrence Kaplan,My feeling. I admire Joseph Epdteirn's stories and essays.   But this  piece of unfunny ill informed  illogical tripe??? One wonders if Epstein is suffering from the cognitive decline that others ascribe to Biden. 
Daniel O Jaramillo,"Careful WSJ,  the lefties did not like this at all.  Why they may just obviate  you.   Couldn't use that real word, you know.  "
Steve Borst,"Anything with the name Epstein on it gives me the shivers these days.Signed,Dr. Jennifer, PhD"
WAH Holloway,You don't know a single person named Epstein?Surely
Victor Deka,"Is this how accomplished professors of english in the USA write essays? Pretty sad, and reflects badly on both WSJ and Northwestern University."
Victoria Baumfield,"The answer is that he was never a ""professor of English"", based on the statement that Northwestern issued about his employment,  he was an adjunct lecturer, not a full-time academic with research and other commitments."
Dawn Harlor,"I love wsj. Always have, always will. But the quality of their opinion pieces has never waivered -- unadulterated garbage. Get a life Epstein. This is sad and desperate."
James N Brennan,Where do you tend bar?
john CHILES,I read the WSJ but not the editorials.  Took a look at Epsteins after all the hoopla and add this to the list of reasons to ignore the WSH opinion pages.  Keep up the good work on all the other fronts
John Agnew,I agree 100%. The reporters are excellent. The op-ed page is probably popular with people struggling to read Ayn Rand.
Shimer George,"As a youngster, the romantic  scenes in Ayn  Rand novels were awesome.  The rest was infantile dreams of how how the real world works. "
Sebastian Massimini,"I met my wife in graduate school and she finished her DSc before I did.  We were judging a science fair and the lady running the fair introduced us as ""Dr. and Mrs. Massimini.""  I could not resist noting to the lady while pointing at my wife, ""She is both of those. But call us Vince and Pat.""  "
Richard Hobart,"A rather pathetic and traditional misogynistic attack.  This person earned her academic title.  She deserves the respect of the title, should she choose to use it.    By the way the first Ed.D in the US was granted by Harvard in 1921.She is now going to be indentured to a job that does pays her nothing and yet demands everything from her.  The real fraud is that the US has these expectations of free labor on behalf of the United States from their ""First Lady"".  In an outdated, paternal way, the government does not feel any financial obligation to financially recognize her, unlike the Chief of Staff or the Press Secretary.Like many people and politicans, the author is expecting a whole lot of something for nothing."
Steve Borst,"And she plans to keep working. Good on you, Dr. Jill Biden."
Christopher FitzGerald,Dr. Kissinger to ER stat!
Pat Wirry,"I don't remember Condoleezza ""Condi"" Rice regularly being referred to as Dr. Rice.  I don't believe misogyny was the reason.  From an article about Henry Kissinger in a ""progressive "" news paper: ""At different times, he has been a consultant to ABC News and CBS; his most successful diplomacy, indeed, has probably been conducted with the media (and his single greatest achievement has been to get almost everybody to call him ""Doctor"""
RANJIT MOHAN,I thought at 83 one would have a little wisdom. What a silly old man Mr. Epstein is!
James N Brennan,Old? ARE YOU AN AGEIST? Just asking. 
Shimer George,No we assume age leads to wisdom. No so much in this case. 
Lawrence Kaplan,I really think that Joseph eEpstein who once was a fine essayist must be at the age of 83 suffering from cognitive decline. How could the WSJ be so blind and cruel  as to allow him to demean himself in this manner? 
Sebastian Massimini,"Petty beyond belief. Yeah, I have a DSc, and I tell anyone who calls me ""Dr."" to please use ""Vince.""  But the lady worked for her degree and can use the title if she prefers.  Frankly, if I were her I'd prefer ""Dr."" to ""First Lady.""I am embarrassed that the WSJ would publish such rubbish.Vince Massimini, DSc"
Dan R,"The issue is hypocrisy.  Scrappy Joe from Scranton acts like he is of the common people, but he prefers that they call his wife an elitist, pretentious title to acknowledge her Ed.D. from URI."
F Jan,"I would say from all the extraordinarily vehement replies below that there are a lot of EdD's and other PHD's with their feelings hurt.  Those of us that have been around for a while will remember the old saying about BS, MS and PHD.(Clue to those who don't know the last one means piled higher and deeper)"
Steve Borst,"Cannot disagree with you. I wasted a lot of time getting my PhD(Human Genetics), and looking back, I probably would have been better off taking a different track..  But as I have it, it is mine to use as I see fit. You can't take that away from me, nor can you take it away from Dr. Jill Biden. Want to argue that point further? Do the work and get yours, and then we can talk."
Steve Borst,"Oh also, it's ""Those of us who,"" not ""Those of us that."" I also happen to have a degree in journalism and use those skills to this day as well."
Steve Borst,"I so shiver when people try to mansplain. ""Those of us who have been around for a while.""Jennifer, PhD 1999""been around awhile"""
Michele Adaline,"This seems very petty. She earned her degree, if she wants to use the title let her. Who is it hurting?"
Dan R,"If you sell yourself as the agent of the common people as scrappy Joe from Scranton does, but if then you prefer that people address your wife with elitist, pretentious titles to acknowledge her Ed.D. then something does not add up now does it?"
Victoria Baumfield,"Actually, it is Dr. Biden who has the right and authority to determine what title she goes by.  Your assumption that it is President-elect Biden's choice how people address his wife says more about you than about anybody else, Dan."
Dan R,"Victoria, But Joe needs to tell the truth then that he married an elitist, pretentious woman who is out of touch with common working class people because she insists that people address her with an academic and paper title based upon schooling that those who work in Walmart full time to support families would never have the luxury to pursue.   This is not the image that Biden and his wife project.  Sorry.  "
Rabi I.,What is 'elitist' and 'pretentious' about spending long years teaching in community colleges and working hard to earn a EdD?
Shimer George,How is the title pretentious. She earned it and you didn't. End of story. 
Dan R," Whoopi Goldberg believed she was an MD and should be a candidate for Surgeon General.   People are misled by such a title.  Call yourself Junior College Instructor or whatever she does for a living, but among those with a PhD like me it is pretentious to constantly reference your academic education unless you are addressing students in an academic setting. Jill Biden is speaking to the media as the spouse of a politician.  The media are not her junior college students.  "
Steve Borst,This makes no sense whatsoever.
Steve Borst,"Let's hear more about your qualifications to criticize. Please elaborate.There is nothing wrong with Dr. Jill Biden's decision to use her earned title. If you think it's wrong, then you are wrong. Again, when you have done your graduate coursework, passed your prelims and defended your dissertation, you will be qualified to speak on this topic."
Christopher FitzGerald,"Dr. Kissinger to ER, stat!"
Sai Ravi Tatapudi,"A Ph.D represent a candidate's  years of hard work and dedication in the fields of science, art or medicine. As somebody who worked with a few amazing researchers with Ph.D, I cannot agree with the author's argument that a Ph.D has lost its value due some honorary doctorate's fraudulent or criminal actions. SincerelyTS"
Daniel Killingsworth,"Well, this will be an interesting four years"
F Jan,"By the responses below it seems like the majority of the respondents believe, like Whoopi, that Dr Jill's a medical doctor.  "
Christopher FitzGerald,"Dr. Kissinger to ER, stat!"
James N Brennan,That's why they call themselves Doctor! 
Dale Roberts,"I thought only teachers referred to school administrators with Ed.D degrees as Dr.  Most  of the Ed.D holders have completed most the study requirement for their M.Ed and Ed. D  through in-service and on-line training offered by the school systems, attendance being the main requirement for passing, and then presented a paper about some educational subject no one cares about.  This is just teachers presenting each other with advanced degrees in order to qualify for greater pay on school pay scales that reward credits earned with more pay.  You can tell who the teachers are with this type of degree, they are teachers and school administrators. There are some bright people who attend legitimate universities and complete a rigorous residential course of study and earn a Ed. D, that really means something,  you can tell who these people are,  they aren't teachers or administrators, they are too smart for that, they are consultants."
Katherine Cagle,"Dale, where did you get your information?  No one gets a PhD or an EdD because they attended workshops.  I have an MLS but workshops don't confer a higher degree, they just let me keep up the education I already have.  Workshops are just like ABA continuing legal education, which doesn't confer a degree but just allows lawyers to keep abreast of current law.  If you are going to post, get your information from legitimate sources."
Steve Borst,What a smarmy mansplain response. I grew up with a super talented educator of a mother who couldn't finish her EdD because she ended up raising two kids as a single mom. And a one-time stepfather who was an abusive son of a ... who had an EdD. How that person was put in charge of small human beings remains beyond my comprehension. Your comments are completely baseless.   
James N Brennan,Thank you Sir!
Steve Borst,"If you are replying to me, it's not a sir. Logged in with hb accountDr. Jennifer, PhD 1999:)"
Samira Chatrathi,"I did not know that.   I also didn't know that there was an  EdD degree.  Article was informative.  I tire of people who are so supremely biased feeling victimized by anything that gives the slightest push back.  Its like pointing out that Obama did senseless Drone strikes  killing 90% innocents, or that his mother is white and father is a Kenyan that might not equate to generational intrinsic bias or that Kamala Harris is actually a Tamil Brahmin by upbringing but all these inconvenient truths challenge the progressive mind even though they shouldn't.   We know NY times is incapable of publishing opinion pieces  without getting their editor fired hopefully WSJ  will not capitulate to this cancel culture environment."
Kevin Barclay,"Could not agree more, thank you for posting. "
F Jan,"Joseph, Thank you for this needed article.  After Whoopi suggested she'd make a great Surgeon General it seemed people needed to understand that she wouldn't be the one you'd want to call if you were having a medical emergency. "
David Chambers,"I promise you, if it was your daughter who earned her doctorate (Ed.D or otherwise),  you would be rightfully upset if someone minimized the respect she is entitled to after years of work and research, especially if she achieved it later in life. Dr. David Chambers, Ed.D."
Christopher FitzGerald,"Dr. Kissinger to ER, stat!"
mark frieser,"It was funny the first time you posted it, less so thereafter. "
Kevin Barclay,Anyone who gets upset over something like this just might be a little too sensitive. 
Jian Shen,"It is up to Jill Biden to decide, otherwise none of you nosy people's business.  "
Robert Lemke,Why do I even bother to subscribe to the WSJ?
Jian Shen,Because you liked its foreign insensitivity.
Jian Shen,Because it represents kangaroo justice.
George Walls,I found this a nice light-hearted commentary advising humility as she steps onto the world's biggest stage.  Some of the letter writers might take the same advice.  
Katherine Cagle,"Why is he advocating humility for someone else?  He also made a silly argument when he said he taught with a BA degree and didn't want people calling him doctor.  Of course, they shouldn't.  It would be conferring a degree he didn't earn.  I guess he calls that humility, and, no, if he had an honorary degree, he shouldn't be called doctor either.  A very silly article."
Dan R,"The issue is pretentiousness of the elite.  I have a PhD, but I do not request that people call me ""Doctor"" when I attend my wife's work functions and fund-raising functions, which are often political in nature.  The scrappy kid from Scranton, along with his wife, are not as in touch with common people as he likes to make you believe.    They prefer pretentious titles.   "
Christopher FitzGerald,"Dr. Kissinger to ER, stat!"
Dan R,"Kissinger never acted like he was a scrappy kid from Scranton.  He obviously is an elitist.  On the other hand, he is an international expert in foreign policy and such experts do get by with being called ""Doctor"" even though they are a PhD."
Scott McDonald,"Wow, the humility you've demonstrated in requesting people NOT call you doctor is admirable.  Thank you for letting us know about it.   I too find it annoying when people like Dr. Martin Luther King  choose names to make themselves sound pretentious.   Obviously not in touch with the common man he pretended to serve.    "
Dan R,"MLK was practicing Theology at his Baptist church as Minister and using his Doctoral degree in Theology.  He was not attending his spouse's political functions and requesting that people address him as ""Doctor"".  Sorry no equivalence."
James N Brennan,"I think what  he did  was known as""ministering"". "
Daniel Killingsworth," Seriously, the woman has an EdD, not a PhD.  And she insists on being called ""Dr"".  Hilarious."
Sai Ravi Tatapudi,"EdD is a Doctorate in Education. I don't understand the problem if she insists on being called ""Dr""."
Daniel Killingsworth,"I've worked with quite a few PhDs in a non academic requirement. No one ever requested they be called ""Dr"".  Ever.  The problem is that she insists on her title as the wife of ""Lunchbox Joe"", Everyman."
BRIAN  A PATTERSON,"@allreplys about being embarrassed...I completely agree.  I opened this thinking there was a light, maybe joyful story about Dr. Biden, but instead this trifle, pathetically pedantic and senseless article.  Shame on Epstein and the editors for allowing this to publish."
bahar ulupinar,"I am female and have my PhD in  Finance and I remember that I did not have time to go to grocery shopping during my PhD years.  It is a well deserved title! Oh wait, why do I need to explain myself! I just want to say ""such an idiot!"""
Dan R,Except that Jill has an Ed.D. and not a Ph.D.   Big difference as was pointed out many times today.
Katherine Cagle,"Dan R,  It isn't a big difference.  It is just a difference in the area of concentration.  She still earned a doctorate.  "
Daniel Killingsworth,No.  They are *very* different
Victoria Baumfield,"They both require a dissertation based on significant research and analysis.  So how exactly are they ""very different""?    "
Steve Borst,"No. They are not ""very"" different. Please let us know your credentials so that we can understand your condescending way of thinking."
David Schmidt,It's a title just to bolster someone's fragile ego. It's ridiculous. The fact that hundreds of first time WSJ commenters are coming to this woman's rescue is quite the phenomenon!
Victoria Baumfield,"I think the person with the fragile ego here is Epstein, who apparently can't handle that a female academic is entitled to a better title than he was entitled to.   If titles are so ridiculous, then I presume you say ""Mr. Trump"" rather than ""President Trump""?"
David Schmidt,What does Trump have to do with this discussion? I didn't vote for him and don't care what title if any he wants. 
Chris Beattie,"Embarrassing. The WSJ quibbles itself into obscurity, over professional titles that its majority of readers reject as irrelevant signs of elitist expertise.  Oh, by the way, Rep. Jim Jordan, should Dr. Strauss remove his Dr.  Title as well?"
Mike Tinsley,"What do you expect from an 83 year old borderline academic Trump supporter with a sour grapes attitude toward the world . . . and especially toward individuals more accomplished and mannerly than him? This is not an opinion piece . . . it was a petty  ""grievance"" piece."
James N Brennan,I'll bet you don't refer to Senator Diane Feinstein as an 87 year old borderline Hillary Clinton supporter? Ageist? Just asking. 
Fan Yu,"I told myself a while ago I am reading WSJ for only its financial news coverage. I am not going to waste time on the opinion pieces. Well, I wasted my time again!"
J Carlin,"I am all for diversity of opinion. In fact, it is why I am a daily reader of The NYT, The Washington Post, Al Jazeera English, and especially the Wall Street Journal. As a general moderate with some views that would be considered ultra conservative and others that would be considered exceptionally liberal, I want to be challenged to develop my thoughts and ideas on topics, especially pivotal topics of the day. I always share that The WSJ is my preferred news source both for the quality of its reporting and the quality of its opinion page. That does not change the fact that this opinion piece is sexist and misogynistic. That is why it should not have been printed. And no, I will not be cancelling my subscription. I will post my thoughts here, possibly my first comment ever, and be sure to continue to call out sexist commentary instead of running away from it."
Dan R,Sexism to a leftist is criticizing a leftist woman.
J Carlin,"Dan, you do realize that of your various posts here, you've done nothing but the same...criticize someone for disagreeing with you? In this case, the opinion is clearly sexist and one that would certainly not be made to a man."
Dan R,I have not called people sexist for disagreeing with me.
J Carlin,"Correct, you have not. You have lodged multiple ad hominem posts however. Clearly, for you, calling someone ""leftist"" is intended to be derogatory for example. You have not actually offered a lucid rationale as to why you feel the why you feel. I suspect you can Dan, but you haven't. You're posts appear to based on disagreement and frustration. I get that. Frankly, I think we all get that irrelevant of our political views right now. I know I am also frustrated for sure. And, to the topic at hand, this opinion piece is a clear example of sexism writing as I cannot imagine this piece being written if a female was elected President and her husband had his Doctorate in Economics for example, such that he should then go by Mr. First Gentleman instead of the Dr. title he had earned."
Dan R,"@J Carlin, look at Michael O'Connor's post as an example.  It is possible to disagree and criticize without invoking sexism and misogyny.  Yes it is possible.  Just open your mind and learn something beyond what you were taught in your diversity training etc. at university.  "
Kevin Barclay,I'm with Dan on this one. The article merely criticism. The ubiquity of -ism charges are so overused they are meaningless and diminish the seriousness of actual victims. I think it's time to bring free speech back. 
MICHAEL O'CONNOR,"It didn't strike me so much as sexist or misogynistic.  Instead,  Epstein's opinion piece struck me as petty, pathetic, absurd, and undeserving of WSJ print space.  My sense (as a reader) was that gender had nothing to do with it.   It was simply bizarre (although I do have more of a barn-yard-ish description that would probably not elevate the discourse)."
James N Brennan,Please share your barn-yard-ish description with us? We await with breathless anticipation.
Roger Cohen,"What a thoroughly foul, sexist, anti-intellectual, uninformed, and poorly-reasoned editorial.  WSJ--where are your (once mostly-reliable) standards? .Were the senior op ed staff  giving their brains and editorial acumen a few days off?  As many others have said, comes a time  to live your convictions and speak with your feet, which means it's time to unsubscribe and stop giving credence to your stentorian male posturing. "
max hensley,"I enjoyed Epstein's puncturing the ostentatious soon-to-be First Lady.  But she is not entirely without talent as a physician.  She managed to prop her addled and confused husband up in a hostile environment (the debates), and then kept him quiet with milk and cookies in the basement the rest of the time.  When Joe, like Woodrow Wilson, has his stroke in a year or two, I have confidence that Dr. Jill, like missus Wilson, will have the skills to guide Joe's hand on the ship of state."
Paul Balcer,"The backlash was swift, as expected and with good reason. I am all for WSJ allowing for diverse opinions but I fail to see the wisdom of a bully pulpit to foment sexist and misogynistic drivel from a man who has an inferiority complex towards women who hold advanced degrees? I am sure Mr. Epstein would not have written an article about a man who had an Ed.D."
Dan R,"Leftists love to invoke sexist and misogynistic drives, as long as they are defending Leftist women,  But they are silent as mice when it comes to defending Sarah Palin.This is a bit of their own medicine that they used against Sarah in constantly claiming that she did not have credentials.  Welcome to politics when you are on the losing side!"
Paul Balcer,"Sara Palin has a bachelor's degree in communications and therefore, would not be called a ""Dr."" regardless of her political affiliations."
MICHAEL O'CONNOR,"Although I never heard of Mr. Epstein before this weekend, my bet is that he would have written the same article about a man.  It almost seemed like more of a politically motivated silly potshot.  I bet that gender had nothing to do with it.  Just my hunch."
Dan R,Great point Michael!
James N Brennan,"Actually, he written several. Do you ever buy books? Or read magazines?"
THADDEUS WONG,"Seriously, what a stroke. This is all about him. What a ridiculously insecure read. "
Cindy Fryman,"I would be OK with the outrage if the same outraged readers would acknowledge that they have also been outraged  over the past four years with the inane criticism of EVERYTHING Trump.  Otherwise, your outrage is totally empty.Tom F"
Philip Russo,"I can see where the one thing has to do with the other - not!  Come on, let's focus on the issue at hand.  On this and every debate.   "
Rebecca Alex,"Mr. Supposed Writer - Mr. Epstein - Joey - kiddo: a bit of advice on what might seem like a small but I think is not an unimportant matter.  Any chance you might drop the Mr. and Epstein? Mr. Epstein sounds and feels a touch fraudulent, not to mention comical, for someone taking such a juvenile position.  Let's just stick with Joey."
MICHAEL O'CONNOR,That was very funny.  Artfully done.  :)
Robert Burton,"As a physician who has delivered a baby, I am happy to address the First Lady as Dr. Jill Biden"
Daniel Killingsworth,"As someone who worked with PhDs, no one ever insisted on being called ""Dr"" like Dr. Biden.  Ever.  "
Victoria Baumfield,"That's funny.  Now that I am in academia, I work with plenty of PhDs, and most use their title where appropriate.  How many of the PhDs that you worked with were women?  I do find that it sometimes becomes more necessary for us women to use our titles as a counter to some of the sexist treatment out there, like when our male assistants are treated better than us until we correct the person we are dealing with, or when it is expected that we will be the one to handle the lunch order during a meeting, etc, even though there are less senior men present.  Or how about the co-counsel on a case I was working on whose secretary continually, for years filtered out my emails as though they were coming from a legal assistant until I reluctantly added the pretentious ""Esq."" to my e-signature.  "
Julio Fernandez,"Do not bother.  The article by Epstein is getting trolled.  Just check the snowflakes below, for most this is their first and only comment in their profiles.  "
David Schmidt,"I know! It's quite the phenomenon. Twitter has unleashed a purported cancel culture mob on these pages and it only shows how insecure the woke culture of elitism truly is. Paul Gigot has already called their bluff, and all of them will now scurry back into their dark caves. "
DAN R TAYLOR,Mr. Epstein's comments were a low blow and far beneath the Wall Street Journal's editorial pages.  It's disappointing that he was given a platform by the Wall Street Journal.  
Dan R,There are people who are very threatened by diverse opinions.  Sad.
Linda Lockett,I'll be cancelling my WSJ subscription.  Deplorable decision to print this garbage.
Dan R,I enjoy diversity of opinion.  Some do not.
Joel Moman,"So, this Joseph Epstein calls himself educated? He should return his diploma wherever he got it from and demand a refund. His employer should investigate his academic credentials. Meanwhile he should be suspended without pay. No more publishing any article he writes till he earns a PhD. A honorary PhD does not count."
James N Brennan,Where did you go to college? Epstein was graduated from the University of Chicago. Check it out dum-dum.
Katie Z,"Why did the WSJ publish this piece of garbage? Not only is it replete with faulty logic, it's completely deficient of social utility. Why is the author comparing an honorary doctorate to one that was earned through academic study? Even if he doesn't think highly of the rigors of a  specific doctorate, the fact still remains that a person who holds a doctorate may be called ""Dr."" In fact, it's common to call professors of humanities ""Dr.  X"" or ""Dr. Y."" The title is not conferred based on any perceived or actual measurement of rigor of curriculum. The biggest problem with this article is that it serves no greater purpose than to undermine the accomplishments of one woman. Are we hurting anyone when we call her ""Dr. Jill Biden"" instead of ""Mrs. Biden""? The answer is obviously NO, so questions relating to this author's intentions are very valid. Please, WSJ, stop publishing click-bait, poorly reasoned, sub-intelligent articles like this one. "
Dan R,"I am sensing that many in this discussion have never seen an Ed.D. held by a woman criticized, or more generally, never seen a Left leaning woman criticized in terms of her credentials.  They act offended like this is something completely foreign to their experience, which I suspect has been at a very sheltered university or corporation where only left leaning political correctness was enforced without any diversity of thought, so they have never heard an opposing point of view.Welcome to the real world!"
David Schmidt,Elitism needs to be cut down a few notches. 
Dan R,"They love diversity, as long as everybody thinks exactly the same monolithic, elitist, leftist message that they have learned in their many years sheltered away at a university.  "
David Schmidt,Yes indeed. It is a key reason why Trumpism is still a thing. 
Elizabeth Hull,"Sexism is a key reason why Trumpism is still a thing. Jill Biden earned her degree. I can guarantee he would not have written this about a man. His point about PhD's not requiring language tests anymore is incorrect. I am  working towards my masters and I have to pass a proficiency exam in a foreign language. It is not elitism to have someone bestow a title of recognition upon them. It would be elitist if she was correcting people for not calling her Dr. I'm frankly tired of people dismissing outrage as ""group think"" or being ""snowflakes."" I'd also pay attention to most of the people not offended by this post are men."
James N Brennan,Proficiency exam in a foreign language? What field  are you seeking a masters degree in? With all due respect?
Mark Sellke,Tom here.The article is l`ese-majest'e against a prominent member of the tribe of half-wits who claim the right to rule us.
Brett Clay,"You are right  that Mr. Epstein's article is a stark reminder of the misogyny, racism, classism and all the other trappings of white male privilege that still exist. "
Kevin Barclay,"You forgot to mention that we are all rapists, too. "
Dr. Miles Conway,"Dear Ex-Professor Epstein-Mr. Epstein-Joseph-Schmucko:

As a gentleman in his eighties one would expect you to act your age, in short be a mensch.
But no, you have resorted to ad hominen that most have castigated as 'misogyny' but in essence
what you have done is much darker, namely ""Shiksa Bashing"" of our First Lady.

This requires you to reconcile your glaring double standard treatment of prominent socio-political
figures of your era in the form of Drs. Alan Greenspan, Ph.D., Milton Friedman, Ph.D., and especially Henry Kissenger, Ph.D., who went by no other moniker than DOCTOR.

Unless you reconcile this, you may be accused of being a hypocritical altakaka.With respect to your unnamed source of the child delivery litmus test for the use of Dr., does this apply to MD Doctors Rand Paul, Neal Dunn,  Mark Green,  John Joyce et al., and especially Dr. Scott Atlas, MD ?You Sir, owe Dr. Jill Biden, Ed.D., an unreserved apology !Sincerely,Dr. Miles Conway (BBA, MBA, MS, Ph.D.)"
James N Brennan,Hey pal: look it up. In 1987 Max Frankel assumed the Editor-in-chief job at the NYT . He famously decreed that only an MD would be referred to as Doctor or Dr. in the pages of the New York Times. No exceptions. 1987. Just saying........
J A,"It's 2020 pal. Why are you referencing 1987? Let's just stay stuck in the past. Why stop at 1987? Where's 1802 at, I need my hose and buggy carriage bud."
David Schmidt,"WSJ editorial page editor, Paul Gigot, has a notice for all you would be unsubscribers: ""These pages aren't going to stop publishing provocative essays merely because they offend the new administration or the political censors in the media and academe.""Anyone out there need any aloe vera?"
Christina Rodriguez MBA,"Aloa vera: Mark Lasswell? Mitt Romney? It's only offensive because it's the WSJ, it's not offensive when Carl Tuckerson says it,  that's to be expected, consider the source.  Dr. Jill Biden was known this way since she was Second Lady, that was the time to bring it up, and maybe it was.  "
James N Brennan,Who's Carl Tuckerson?
Christina Rodriguez MBA,"He goes by Tucker Carlson, but no way is that his real name."
Michael Ceres,"I've always considered any ""Doctorate"" outside of the medical, pharmacological,  chemical fields, as suspect.  "
Steve Borst,"Well that makes you pretty short sighted.Jennifer, PhD, Human Genetics"
Linda Robb,"You have got to be kidding.  She earned it. She graduated with a ""doctorate."" This is a a cheap shot, WSJ.  Why? what does it matter to you?  Dr. is an honorific to which she is entitled.  This article demeans her life's work, her education, her status.  I can't even write enough to show my utrage.  WSJ has mocked her achievements.I can't even be articulate in my outrage.  "
David Schmidt,"I agree, you can't. "
Elizabeth Hull,"David - if you have a wife or daughter - I hope you would be upset if someone tried to knock down their achievements. You are part of the problem with messages like these. Try watching on Netflix ""I am not an easy man."" It might enlighten you."
David Schmidt,"I don't need some rando Twitter scold to advise me on misogyny. If you don't get how totally corrosive intersectional mentality is, then I can't help you.  This has nothing to do with Jill Biden being a woman, just as all my criticism of Obama had nothing to do with racism. This is about pretentious titles being carried out of the workplace because some folks are insecure. This whole faux outrage is ridiculous. "
Kevin Barclay,"It's not only ridiculous, it's exhausting because it's unavoidable because claws all over social media conversations. "
Brett Clay,"Mr. Epstein,Of course, you are envious of people who worked their tails off and made huge sacrifices to earn a Ph.D., while you didn't. One can imagine how you always felt like a lesser person at Northwestern without a Ph.D. You might consider getting therapy for the unresolved feelings you have about your life choices and how you feel were treated.WSJ Editorial Board,I have considered dropping my WSJ subscription many times due to the deeply flawed, racist, classist, misogynist, opinions written by privileged white males that you publish in the Op-Ed section.  It is a disservice to the world, that James Murdoch could not prevail in convincing Rupert and others to bring rational, evidence-based commentary that does not simply perpetuate rich, white, male privilege. (I am a white male, BTW). The only reason I'm still here is that your reporting of the SCOTUS decision about Cuomo vs the Jewish churches in NYC was very balanced. "
Michael Ceres,"Your forgot to include that the WSJ hates clean air, clean water, etc. etc.  "
Brett Clay,"I'm less angry about Mr. Epstein, whose inability to see the hypocrisy of criticizing Dr. Biden's dissertation while his dissertation wasn't even a blank sheet of paper, qualifies him as an idiot.I am, however, outraged that the WSJ Editorial Board would contaminate what should be hallowed pages of the institution that is the WSJ Newspaper with trash-talk that could be found in a dive-bar after midnight, or a playground in a rough neighborhood after school. Those people have an excuse--being drunk and adolescent, respectively. The Editorial Board has no excuse.  It subscribes to no moral or ethical standard other than to perpetuate one view (""conservative"") and attack people it sees as enemies of that view (""anyone else""). There is little doubt that if a situation such as John Snow and the Broad Street pump existed today, the Editorial Board would attack Dr. Snow as a radical leftist. What happened to sane, rational discourse based on provable facts? "
rebecca jones,"WSJ, you have got to be kidding me.  Add me to the list of people who have lost respect."
Heidi Baxter,The WSJ used to be the gold standard of journalism that we young folks just starting out in the financial services biz in the early 80s all revered. Truly heartbreaking how far this organization has fallen. In the middle of a devastating pandemic with thousands dying each day the editors think this is a topic your subscribers care about. Well I no longer will be one as of tomorrow when your phones lines open. 
Brett Clay,"Yes, Heidi. I went to cancel my subscription and discovered there is no way to do it without calling customer service. Just more insult to injury. I can't wait to see how long traversing the customer service guantlet takes in the morning."
Antonio G,A politicians wife seeking headlines to take food of the table of a young teacher by taking a JOB.
DIANA KELLY,"According to Joseph Epstein's biography on the Northwestern University website, he holds a B.A. degree.  He has NO IDEA how much work it is to earn a doctorate!  He didn't do it himself!  He is just a wanna-be academic who likes to write about his opinions (based on nothing).  He was a ""lecturer"" at Northwestern University - until they condemned his ""essay"" about Dr. Jill Biden and removed him.  Mr. Epstein -- I suggest you enroll in a doctoral program (if one will take you) and see how much work is involved.  In the meantime, let those of us who DO hold doctorates decide whether or not we prefer to be called ""Dr.""  or Ms. or Mr. or First Lady or whatever.  To the Wall Street Journal -- I strongly recommend that you evaluate the qualifications of those who write opinion pieces to be sure that they are qualified to write on the topic.  Mr. Epstein clearly was NOT qualified!"
K Carroll,He is not at all qualified to write his opinion and to have it published.  The entire piece says far more about his sour grapes than it does about anyone who has worked hard for their doctoral degree.  
Trevor Sutherland,WSJ going all Breitbart and OANN because that's where the meat of the base is now. FOX is now just hard-core CNN...
David Schmidt,"I won't call Jill Biden doctor but I will call her First Lady.

You're gonna have to deal with that. Or not. I can't decide for you.I'm just putting it out there for all you cancel culture warriors to digest. "
Matthew Crabtree,"Why are we going to have to deal with it? Who are you, anyway? "
John Bezirganian,"The predominent usage of ad hominem arguments against Ebstein means that he must have a good argument.  Virtually none of his opponents say that they themselves if they had a doctorate in education they themselves would use it in the social world outside of work, which was his point.   "
David Schmidt,Exactly John. It's ridiculous. To use that title outside of someone's line of work says to me that someone's ego is invested in letting everyone know that someone has a higher degree. It's quintessential elitism and it reeks. 
Brett Clay,"We presume that both John and David have ""standing"" to make this argument? That is, they both hold Ph.D.s and choose not to use those titles outside of the universities in which they teach or conduct research?"
Victoria Baumfield,"Based on your argument, I presume that you call your medical doctor acquaintances ""Mr"" or ""Ms"" when you see them outside of the doctor's office?"
David Schmidt,I am a doctor and no one calls me doctor outside my office. 
Tina Seymour,It's not up to you to decide. She earned the credential and prefers the title. She is entitled to it.  To refuse to use the title shows your rudeness. 
Randy Bullard,The manufactured lefty outrage is tiresome.  Ists and isms and outrage!Bravo Mr. Gigot for not giving in to the pettyist of politics.
Linda Robb,"This is not about lefty outrage. This is about acknowledging Dr. Jill Biden's life's work, valuing teaching,. How does such a poor excuse for an editorial be admitted to the WSJ?"
Samuel Rosado,What does this article has to do with leftist or rightist? I do not see the connection with this article in relation to politics other that we are addressing the first lady. Every thing politics in America. 
Julio Fernandez,"Well said.  Even the sciences PhD of today are a joke.  If you are admitted to any graduate program, you will get your PhD no matter what you do.  Can you imagine the ululing outrage if a graduate student pertaining to one of the vitims-du-jur groups is failed?  No.  It does not happen any more.  Same with the MD's.  Good luck to us all."
Brett Clay,"How do you know? Did you earn a Ph.D. or M.D. degree? Do you know how hard or how little one must work, and the life sacrifice one must make, to earn the grades required to get into a top medical school or doctoral program?"
Victoria Baumfield,"That's funny.  I have been in academia for the past 12 years and I am certainly aware of cases where people never received their PhD.  You don't know what you're talking about, Julio."
Janet Chap,Others have noted that it was beneath the standards of the WSJ to have published this but I would argue it is beneath the standards of all decent people. It made me sick to read such hateful comments. I believe in free speech and freedom of the press but something is seriously awry with your editorial board. You owe Dr. Jill Biden and apology. 
David Schmidt,"This is not a product of the editorial board and no, no one owes anyone an apology. This whole freak out is ridiculous. "
Al Comeaux,"Dude picked a fight for no good reason. Made a name for himself, maybe??"
Sapna Bhargava,Andy was right. I guess. 
Evelyn Croft,Well done. Maybe if more Democrats with doctorates actually delivered children Ruth Bader Ginsburg would be less of a role model for their OB GYN ethics.
BETH HARRISON,"I think I will be cancelling my subscription to the Wall Street Journal - As a professional woman, it's so insulting to even read an article that suggests the first lady should lose an aspect of her professional identity & title, because it bothers a journalist.  Absurdity, and misogyny at it's finest.  See ya later WSJ"
Jennifer Crispin,He's not a journalist. He's just some guy who inexplicably was given a platform.
Brett Clay,"I can't tell you how many times I've considered cancelling my WSJ subscription. The Op-Ed pages are not only infuriatingly ignorant, but are disgustingly racist, misogynistic, classist, and every other affliction of white, male privilege."
Mark Neustrom,There should be no room at the WSJ for this kind of misogynistic diatribe.
Janel Lardizabal,Behold the mediocre white male with the Bachelor's degree asking the woman with the Doctorate to forego a title she earned and he did not. 
Richard Murphy,It's December.  It must be snowing.  Lot of snowflakes here.
David Schmidt,They were all hauled in on the Cancel Culture Twitter internet train looking to hurt the patriarchy. I find this whole freak out laughable. 
Tara Zimmerman,"Golly MISTER Epstein, thanks for reminding us what a purebred sexist pig sounds like. Not that we really forgot, it's just that I thought a credentialed woman with an advanced degree, beyond that which you have earned, would merit a bit more respect. Silly me.   I guess that level of acknowledgment is beyond your Neanderthal level of education, social and ethical capacity. Perhaps you might consider advancing your education in a manners or etiquette school, you know, the kind us gals should stick with. Maybe then you will learn what due respect means. Meanwhile, best you hold your tongue - Kiddo. "
Floyd Gregory,"I cannot remotely find any reason why this would ever have been published.  Whoever was the ""editor"" needs another job or there was not editor on the job.  Embarrassing on so many levels from a publication I have looked to for taste, intelligence and insight for decades.    I expect if not a retraction or apology at least some sort of explanation.   Lacking that, we will have to part ways.   Tomorrow before I call to cancel would be good."
Duane Estelle,"No retraction, no apology.  Doubling down in fact."
Nate Falkner,This article reeks of an ageist misogyny that I frankly just don't have time or energy for. I am a long time subscriber and I canceled my subscription today - not with anger or reactionary rage but with a sad recognition of what the WSJ EB has become. Very disappointed. 
Jack Fain,"This is both completely disgusting and totally unnecessary. Far below the WSJ, or so I thought."
Sapna Bhargava,They are bored and distracting from the electoral college tomorrow. 
Carol Kaplan,Bravo!!  So well said.
Mike German,"Yes, I agree:  Epstein wrote a good read."
Peter Jeffery,"A few points of information here, kiddo: 1. Dr. Jill Biden actually has delivered a child. Have you? 2. Whether to use the title ""Dr."" depends in part on your field. In the medical field, people with doctorates in audiology, nursing, psychology, and other trades are always addressed as ""Dr. Whoever,"" even though their doctorate is not an M.D.3. College professors with PhDs usually do not flaunt the title, because they work in an environment where most professors have PhDs, but that custom doesn't necessarily apply in other fields.  4. In pre-university Education, where most teachers have only Masters, it is normal for people with Doctorates in Education to be called ""Dr."" 5. Student retention is a difficult problem. There definitely are things institutions can do to make it easier for students to stay in school.  The title ""Student Retention at the Community College Level"" is no more ""unpromising"" than a lot of other dissertation titles, and less pretentious than many. "
Richard D. Glaser,"I have a PhD.  My brother is an MD.  We are both doctors.  An EdD degree is a doctorate.  End discussion.  For the most part the mention of these degrees to certain gate keepers used to get you a good table at a nice restaurant - but more importantly, made my mother very proud of her boys.  "
David Schmidt,"I'm an MD. I have one brother who also is an MD. I have two other brothers who are PhDs. None of us call each other doctor. No one calls me a doctor outside my official line of work. So let's drop all the pretense and call her First Lady, or Jill. I really really don't understand what the freak out is all about. Just so dumb. "
J A,"That's because you guys are all family, of course none of you would call each other doctor. You wouldn't refer to your dad as Mr. Schmidt would you? When it comes to honorifics, in formal writing such as newspaper articles or published articles in scientific/medical journals, and all other cases where hard earned titles are concerned,  the point is to use the FULL TITLE. And of course, let's call this what this is: Mr. Epstein is trying to belittle her."
David Schmidt,You missed my point! None of us expect to be called Dr. outside our line of work and nor should Jill Biden. It's a ridiculous thing to defend unless you love faux outrage. And you're dead wrong about newspaper articles. They refer to Ben Carson as...  wait for it.... Ben Carson. Or Rand Paul.  And they're real doctors!
Jennifer Shepard,"You are ridiculous. Many people refer to people with doctorates using the term ""Dr."" outside of work. And AGAIN. As the previous poster stated, it is normal to use someone's formal title when referring to them in an article. This article is also just completely demeaning and belittling. He starts out by calling her ""kiddo."" GIVE ME A BREAK. She is a full grown woman. You do not call a full grown educated woman ""kiddo."" This article is totally offensive. And you are defending nothing aside from small-minded arrogance. Hard to believe you have so much education for someone clearly so soft brained."
Katherine Cagle,I always refer to my doctor as Dr Moyer even when I am not seeing him in his office.  My daughter has a PhD in School Psychology.  She is called Doctor.  My friend has a PhD in Curriculum Development.  She is addressed as Doctor.  Your comment is actually rather pompous.
J A,That's your opinion. Your own opinion is that you don't want anyone to call you doctor outside of work. Fine. But don't project or put that on anyone else. Titles are meant to be used in formal settings. Nobody says Mrs. Windsor to refer to the Queen. 
James Nelson,It really sounds like you're bothered  by the fact she also a Dr. but not in medicine. Insecure??
David Schmidt,"No, because unless I'm at work I don't want anyone calling me doctor. But an Ed.D needs the title everywhere she goes? Now that's insecurity and quite hilarious. "
Kate Hodgins Chambers,"What a petty swipe at a really nice, educated, accomplished woman who earned her PhD. Honorary doctorates are nothing like the real doctorate she has. It's not even comparable and everyone knows it, yet you go on and on.  It's just an excuse for you to attempt to demean her,  but in so doing you have only demeaned yourself "" Mr.""? Epstein. "
Joseph Donahue,"Not sure this should be in the WSJ.  While I agree with some of the other readers that to refer to oneself as ""Dr."" outside of work when one merely has an EdD or a PhD in the humanities or in a ""soft science"" seems like someone is trying too hard.   However, something about this OpEd seems like disguised misogny or even a piece written by someone who has a chip on his shoulder.  While I see the author's point, Jill Biden is someone, as I understand it, who has earned her own way and has continued to do so up to and through her husband's years as VP.  I say keep doing what you are doing Ms. Biden, but lose the ""Dr."", you don't need it.  Mr. Epstein, pick on someone else.  "
Alex Basilevsky,"Forget the small thrill of being Dr. Jill, and settle for the larger thrill of living for the next four years in the best public housing in the world as First Lady Jill Biden.I may be going out on a limb here, but I'm going to guess that having put in the work to successfully earn her doctorate - and that is what it is - is probably a far more meaningful accomplishment for Dr. Biden than becoming First Lady.While it is always dangerous to speculate on someone else's motives, this statement ending the op-ed seems telling. Clearly Mr Epstein believes being President-elect Biden's wife is more important than any accomplishment of hers. Indeed, this rather gives away the passive aggressive misogyny of the entire pierce."
T Mac,"If you read a bit about the author, he has a history of homophobia and racism too.   Called Obama the 'affirmative action President'.   Misogyny, racism and homophobia seem to be the hallmarks of the GOP.   No doubt the WSJ has the right to publish tripe from Epstein.   But I'm pondering tonight why in the world I should be paying for it."
Amanda Delp,"You don't even have to look outside the article to see the author's racism:Political correctness has put paid to any true honor an honorary doctorate may once have possessed. If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try ""rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman."" Mr. Epstein believes that the mere inclusion of African-American women on lists of honorary degree recipients is an indication that the ""value"" of an honorary degree has been diminished. Apparently, not a single African-American woman has ever deserved to be recognized with an honorary degree."
Russell Smith,"Do I sense that this piece was full of bitter regret from an octogenarian who still has a chip on his shoulder as he never put in the excruciating work a doctorate would have demanded of him? The fact that he never used his honorary ""honorific"" is moot. He is obviously well versed in the particular definition and lack of acceptance of ""honorary"" degrees within academic circles. My wife also received her doctorate as a seasoned woman with well earned maturity and admits freely that she reveled in being addressed as ""Dr."" by her students and clients. She continues to wear it and use it proudly even though now retired. Proud of her the day she defended and proud of her now. "
Cerene Setliff,"As if Dr. Biden is going to take advice from this guy.I am no fan of the Bidens. As a professional female, I've also received ridiculous advice from old men over the course of my career. "
Richard Murphy,"If you want some entertainment, read the course descriptions for a Ed.D degree at U Del vs the reqs for a Ph.D. in education.  The Ed.D is simply a degree for those who want to be education administrators.  It isn't intended to be a demanding degree.  And U Del isn't exactly a top school generally or in education.  So, Jill, or anyone else who uses the pretentious title ""Doctor"" when they've simply taken a few additional courses -- or gasp -- attained their degrees on line or from some poorly rated school in some absurd area of study -- should be forthcoming and state their credentials rather than insist they be called Doctor, mister (orMs)  MD, can you tell me, what's ailing me.  U Del doesn't even require the candidate to submit a GRE score.  No research reqs either.  In other words, it's a cheap degrees that helps devalue academic degrees."
Dan R,"A reposting of a very insightful comment from Enid Hinkes earlier today.  This is from Dr. Jill's doctorate dissertation:
""Three quarters of the class will be Caucasian; one quarter of the class will be African American; one seat will hold a Latino; and the remaining seats will be filled with students of Asian descent or non-resident aliens.""
I guess that to get that education degree and call yourself ""Doctor"" you don't need elementary school math.  "
Dan R,"As I pointed out, rigor and good math are not known to be prevalent in Education Departments and among Ed.D. holders.  Faithfulness to Democratic politics and teacher's unions are quite prevalent though.  "
Charles Swanson,"Oddly enough, Epstein is the author of a book called, Charm."
Gary Hale,"Paul Martin (15 June 2010). The Wall Street Journal Guide to Business Style and Use . Simon and Schuster. pp. 71-72. ISBN 9781439122693. ""The abbreviation Dr. should be used in second reference as a title before the names of those who are generally called doctor in their professions in the U.S. ... If appropriate in context and if the individual desires it, Dr. is thus used after the first reference before the names of individuals who hold Ph.D.s and other doctoral degrees. Holders of Ph.D.s in the academic world, for example, often prefer to be called doctor. It usually isn't necessary to specify that the degree is a Ph.D., M.D. or other degree...""   "
Maris Matan,"Did ""Mr."" Epstein stick his fingers in his ears and wiggle them singing neener neener neener after he hit send?  Didn't expect this from the WSJ.  I subscribe for market news, but am beginning to doubt the source right about now."
Senthil Ramachandran,Seriously...Hate has no limit :(
Richard Murphy,as anti-trumpets well know
James Semivan,Would you please elevate the content of your opinion columns?  I enjoy the WSJ but Mr. Epstein's column was simply over the top.  Crude and tone deaf... 
David Abel,Too bad it his opinion has a ring of obvious truth to it!  
Jerry perez,"The only response deserved here is to say that this opinion piece is so far beneath the WSJ, it could have been Newsmax."
John Denison,"Okay, you privileged heterosexual male op-ed guys (probably not much racial diversity in that part of the newsroom either). This hit piece by the elderly tone-deaf homophobe should never have been afforded WSJ ink or pixels. No wonder several hundred true journalists pointed their collective middle fingers at you this past summer. You just won't quit. So I'll do it for you. It'll be the end of my subscription Monday unless editors wake up and offer up a sincere apology and pull the piece from the online archive. You may not have scruples but my conscience will be clearer knowing that I will no longer financially support the Opinion page that's run amok. JD/Palm Springs"
Mike German,"Love your lead sentence, JD, which manages, parenthetical included, to corral at least four clichees in its silly denunciation of somone with whom you simply, however mechanically, disagree."
Anna Giles,"We go from having a First Lady that you can literally find nude pictures of from her days of posing without clothes, to an incoming distinguished doctor in education who has dedicated her life to educating youth, helping the military, and being a devoted mom to a family of a widowed senator with two young boys.  And this is the best you can do to try to criticize the incoming First Lady?  Surely, this is proof of Dr. Biden's unimpeachable character if you have to write such a laughable article.  Question - what did you write 4 years ago about Melania when she was the First Lady To Be?  And what would you write about how she has spent these last four years?  She has not dedicated her life to goodness, and she has not spent these 4 years dedicating her life to goodness.  She cussed about Christmas decorations. The country will be better off without her and her husband in the White House.  Dr. Biden will be an EXCELLENT First Lady!"
Mike Karney,And how many languages does the good Dr. speak?  And how many for the one with nude pictures?  She cussed about Xmas decorations because she has the intelligence to see what the media assumes the role of the First Lady to be. It appears she would have none of the nonsense.  Not so much for the pretentious one.
J A,"What does speaking languages have to do with anything? So if you can speak foreign languages, you're an American patriot? By the way, by being dismissive of Christmas decorations, she was being dismissive of the Lord Jesus Christ and dismissive of American traditionMeanwhile Dr. Jill Biden is literally teaching America's youth and trying to help them learn but...yeah something definitely wrong with her."
Mike Karney,"Dismissing Xmas decorations is being dismissive of Jesus Christ?  She wasn't being dismissive of American traditions, she was being dismissive of the tired, misogynistic notion that women hang Xmas decorations while men work. Being fluent in multiple languages is a sign of innate intelligence, something the pretentious one lacks. BTW, her PhD is in Educational Leadership...what a waste."
Anna Giles,"Oh yeah, that time when the Harvard lawyer Michelle Obama cussed about having to decorate the White House for Christmas....uh, NOT!   Also, if Melania is willfully posing without clothes for money, then I doubt she's worried about misogyny!  So just quit please - Dr. Biden will be the type of First Lady this country deserves!  Melania has been the type of person we would expect to be married to the likes of Donald Trump. Donald and Melania don't belong in the White House as a shining example to our children.  They belong right back in the gawdy Trump Tower where they can be king and queen of their own little selfish kingdom."
Anna Giles,"She cussed about the CHRISTmas decoractions (not Xmas for heaven's sake) because she and her husband are not CHRISTians.  Her husband only used the hypocritical white evangelicals to achieve their political ends.  She, like many immigrants to our country, speak more than one language. But she lied about having a college degree.  She is uneducated and is not in the same league as Dr. Biden or Harvard lawyer Michelle Obama."
Jeffrey P,"Jill Stein is a doctor, just not a medical doctor.  She, like anyone who did the work and obtained a PhD, has every right to use the qualifier in her name if they so choose.This is a total non-issue and forgets many millions of people with advanced degrees do the same exact thing.  If the author is jealous or feels diminished by her being more educated and using the title that goes along with her education, I suggest the author work on their own advanced degree, worry about themselves and focus on matters of substance instead."
Dan R,Except that she has an Ed.D. and not a PhD.  There is big difference as exemplified many times in these posts in past few hours like the example from her dissertation that had a major error in basic elementary math.  
Jeffrey P,"The only difference is, PhD stands for doctor of philosophy and EdD is doctor of education. Take not of the ""doctor"" in the title.They are the same in the sense they are both the abbreviations of obtaining the highest degrees of the field and earning the distinction of ""doctor."""
jes merrell,"The Greek root of ""doctor"" means teacher. It has nothing to do with medicine.She's thus a Doctor twice, by degree and profession.Class arrives. "
Jeffrey P,"JesNothing getting past you, I see. It's a shame you missed the first comment though, as I pointed it out already."
David Abel,"Personally I could care less. I consider her so-called ""Doctorate"" a joke. It's right down there like Obama's Nobel Peace Prize - which some Nobel officers consider an embarrassment. "
Mike German,"Just one problem:  Jill Biden holds an Ed.D., NOT a Ph.D., which is much more difficult to earn - and thereby much more respected - than what's widely regarded as the most worthless of all the doctorates - and not just because so many of those who hold it are notorious for demanding that they be addressed as ""doctor"" while they go about corrupting education at all levels.Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to ask to be addressed as such if I held an Ed.D., but then I avoid adding an ""Esquire"" after my name, even though I am a Juris Doctor.  There is such a thing as modesty, even in these times of academic and intellectual dishonesty, and some things are simply better left unsaid."
Jeffrey P,MikeWho cares how you feel?It is her degree and therefore her decision while academically and culturally it is a valid choice.
JUDITH DOTTI,"The author does not argue that Jill Biden does not have the right to use the title. Instead, he argues that she should not use it.It's a particularly silly practice when that doctoral degree is in education."
Jeffrey P,"JudithWhen he gets an equivalent advanced degree, I suggest him deciding to not use the title then and let those who have advanced degrees decide for themselves."
Katherine Cagle,But who educates all the other professions?
J A,"Buddy - kiddo, don't you have more issues to worry about given your name?  I'd stop worrying about Dr. Jill Biden's.Oh and nobody should call themselves doctor unless he's delivered a child? Well I guess cardiologists, neurosurgeons have been calling themselves the wrong thing this whole time.You sound pompous and so does the title of your book"
PATRICK Woods,Any relation to Jeffery?
jes merrell,"Similar ethics, ie. none. "
Douglas Hansen,"Whoopi and I both thought that Dr. Jill Biden was a medical doctor until reading Mr. Epstein's column.  Perhaps Mr. Epstein is not being very ""healing"". But neither are his detractors. I have a colleague who has a Phd. in Divinity.  His email handle is ""DrDan"", which I have always considered a bit pretentious, and he laughably agrees.  Likewise  I have several other friends who have Phd's in Math and Chemistry.  They would never address themselves or want to be addressed as Dr.  For the reasons Mr. Epstein writes about, save for a ""Phd."" appendage on a paper written in their field of expertise.  So why is it that a clamoring horde of feminists jump to defend ""Dr. Jill"" for her use of the term, including one writing in the other nationally read New York newspaper?  Are we still in an era when women are specially shielded from appropriate skepticism?  Is their a double standard and anyone who expresses skepticism is shouted down or canceled as a sexist or misogynist?  Appears so."
Claudina Veas,"When I call the vet, I introduce myself as Mrs.; when I call a colleague in another institution, I'm Dr. If I were in the White House, I would definitively be Dr. MY CHOICE"
V R,"Douglas Hansen, your colleagues may choose not to call themselves ""Dr."" but that is their choice. Not yours. Not mine. Not Joseph Epstein's. The same holds true for Dr. Jill Biden. Joseph Epstein's op-ed is full of jealously, misogyny, and racism. The WSJ can do better. It's that simple, kiddo.  "
Douglas Hansen,"Ha!  ""Kiddo"".  That's another one gaining traction on the left. Appears twice in these comments. Thanks for your reply, VR, whoever you are. "
V R,To Joseph Epstein: Get a life. To the Wall Street Journal: I expect better. 
Dana Tompkins,"To the WSJ and Mr. (NOT Dr.) Epstein:  Thank you for your wildly ludicrous take (and enabling publication) on honorific titles and your rambling on honorary degrees--of which Dr. Biden's is not. For somebody who's never achieved anything beyond a bachelor's degree, your strong opinion on the ease of earning a doctorate is remarkable. Similar to other subscribers, I considered cancelling my subscription, but changed my mind. It's important that men such as yourself out themselves. Misogyny is rarely tied up so neatly in a bow, but you've come darn close.    "
Bud Youkers,Aw... go ahead. We're behind you.
Mark Sfreddo,Agreed! The criticisms of honorary degrees seem misplaced and designed to insinuate that Dr. Biden's hard-earned Ed.D. is somehow equivalent to a freely-bestowed honorific.
Cynthia Terwilliger,I find this vitriolic and offensive -- I expect more of this newspaper and those whose opinions you publish.  As a past educator and as a woman now in my 70's I find this op ed antiquated and myopic. This misogynist attitude tells much more about Joseph Epstein than it says about any of the tens of thousands of women who have earned their PHDs. Raise your opinion pieces to reach the rest of your journalistic standards.
William Watson,"Does she have a PhD?  I thought she had one of those education degrees that exist primarily to get public school teachers and administrators higher pay under a union contract.  I don't know Mr. Epstein at all so I can't speak for him, but I can assure you I'd apply his analysis to men as well as women.  Dr. Biden just has the misfortune to fit the category while being high profile."
Jill Johnson,This is great. An MD is in another class and it is misleading when PhDs use it. Thanks for this.
Mike German,"Ed.D. =/= Ph.D.  There is a difference, and its a big one."
Michael Wodarcyk,"I always referred to my college professors as ""Doctor."" If she holds a doctorate, then the use of ""doctor"" is appropriate. Michael Wodarcyk, M.D."
Mark McCardell,"The only thing pathetic is Mr Epstein's obvious envy of PhD's. I truly love the WSJ, but the opinion pieces, which includes the editorials, are barely a step above the NY Post.  Now THAT is pathetic. "
Maximilian Drach,I have to agree.  I have been reading WSJ for 25 years.  Ever since New Corp took over the paper it has become Fox News light.  So sad to see what was a great news organization turn into a rag.
Mac Moore,"McCardell writes, "" truly love the WSJ, but the opinion pieces, which includes the editorials, are barely a step above the NY Post.  Now THAT is pathetic.""It seems diversity of opinions just isn't for you.  Check in at any college campus, NYT, LAT or Time magazine, where diversity of opinions is banned, and, may better fit your sensibilities."
J A,"Not true, those organizations frequently employ conservative and libertarian writers, take Hugh Hewitt, George F. Will, and Jennifer Rubin for example. Although their op/ed pages are pretty liberal in nature, it's false to suggest that they don't employ diversity of opinion"
Mark McCardell,The WSJ is not the NYT or LaT. I expect better editorials and opinions pieces from the WSJ. There is a reason I subscribe to the WSJ: excellent journalism and well written opinion pieces. This opinion piece is on the level of the NY Post. It has nothing to do with diversity of opinions.  I suggest if you enjoy juvenile opinion pieces you would be better suited for a lessor newspaper. 
Harry Dhillon,"This was the  most stupid, outdated and sexist opinion piece I've read in any paper this year.  And I'm a guy.  How, in any way, did this serve  your readership, or society in general, WSJ? "
Edward Wolf,"I want my money back if this is what the WSJ thinks is intelligent writing. Here's a thought get some editors!  What an insulting opinion piece. If Epstein wants dumbed down then he should stay in the Trump GOP! Oh and by the way Joe, we have a pandemic killing 3000 Americans A DAY and a seriously deranged President. You should get out more! Oh and WEAR A MASK! "
Ray Noack,"I am stunned at how all the women commenting here use the word misogynist. As if it is cool and they are the first to use it . Good Grief . Where is your pink hat ?. Viva La Resistance!  The argument has nothing to do with women.. It would be the same argument when Harris is sworn in and her husband has the same "" doctorate "" next you will be Championing JK Rowling's many "" Doctorates . The several REAL science PHD do not want to be called Dr. ..Professor is preferred . "
J A,Fake news. Most if not all PhD's go by Doctor although Professor is also accepted if they are in a teaching capacity
Peter Ruff,"I just renewed my WSJ subscription because I saw a post about your op ed and I wanted to write something caustic about your comment on Jill Biden's qualifications to be called ""Doctor"". Her time and effort are commensurate with the degree and therefore the title.I received A DDS degree in 1974. My patients call me ""Doctor""...should I tell them I'm just mister? I wait for your eloquent response."
P Curr,"You paid 50 bucks to write this?  Good grief...and incidentally, your patients are free to call you whatever they want...it's a free country..."
P Ong,Doctor means teacher in Latin so why restrict the term to only doctorates of the health profressions? Getting a PhD takes almost twice as long as getting an MD. Is Mr Epstien even qualified to be an expert the term?
Brett Manning,"A ""Doctor of Philosophy"" is a thing. It is what it is. Words have meaning based on usage and tradition. Someone with an advanced degree from an accredited institution on par with a PhD is a ""Doctor of Philosophy"" in that field. It's not at all easy to achieve. Such an individual does have tremendous expertise in that field.Of all the themes engaged in by either party over recent decades, the ""anti-expert"" theme on the right is probably the dumbest. To demonize education, science, knowledge, etc, is pointlessly counterproductive.  Misplaced credentialism is also a bad thing, but throwing the baby of higher education, science, and secular intellectual progress out with the bathwater is the least productive use of anyone's time and mental energy. Naked populism of the very worst kind. And it destroys value and potential. A similar strain of political DNA in this country is also why we have the moronic anti-mask and anti-vaxxer movements."
MICHAEL WEINSTEIN,I cannot give my hard-earned money to a publication that allows such screed to be published in its pages.   To continue subscribing would be a complete disservice to my PhD daughter and my soon-to-be PhD daughter.  Cancelling my subscription in the morning when your customer service department opens.  I encourage everyone outraged by this hit piece to do the same and contribute what they would have spent on the WSJ to a worthy cause supporting women and minority education.
Susan Ross,Agreed!   Another response mentions  a good sale going on at the Financial Times - I'm switching over in the morning.
Nicole Green,@ Susan is that the best alternate $ news source?
Mark Fisher,"I was a newspaper copy editor for decades. Our standard was to use the title ""Dr."" only for people with such degrees who provided medical care: physicians and dentists. Otherwise we would say, ""Jones, who has a doctorate in sociology"" (or whatever). I believe this rule was set out in the AP Stylebook, and the reasoning was that most people expected ""Dr.  Jane Jones"" to mean the white-coat kind of doctor."
Gary Hale,"AP style book published in 1953 go figure.  The Wall Street Journal's own Style Book written this century would properly call her Dr. Jill Biden.Paul Martin (15 June 2010). The Wall Street Journal Guide to Business Style and Us. Simon and Schuster. pp. 71-72. ISBN 9781439122693. ""The abbreviation Dr. should be used in second reference as a title before the names of those who are generally called doctor in their professions in the U.S. ... If appropriate in context and if the individual desires it, Dr. is thus used after the first reference before the names of individuals who hold Ph.D.s and other doctoral degrees..."""
Katie Goldstein,"Congratulations, Mr. Epstein.  You have revealed yourself to be a pathetic, low self-esteem misfit racked with envy of those having the right stuff to endure years of blood, sweat and tears to achieve what you could not.   Richard Goldstein "
Cindy Fryman,"Dr. Goldstein (I presume),Pretend that the article is critical of someone with the last name Trump.OK,  we're good now.See what we have been putting up with for four years?Tom F (only an MBA)"
Ray Noack,"Just google Walden University or how to get a doctorate in education in California. Our friend has one . It is all done online so you can soak your feet while learning . Getting a masters at University of California in education is way more difficult and rigorous or at least it was in 1978 . Only half of my class of about 20 passed the first time . ( you got to take more classes and try again ) . Our friend got the "" Doctorate "" in about 2.5 years ..all online . Thankfully we can still call her Susan but her husband let on that with parents she refers to herself as Dr. Johnson . My wife is a teacher ( just a plain old teacher ) . She says it is all the rage in her district . Contrast that with our son who got a PHD in Mathematics from University of California in 5 years ( of torment as he put it ) . Only 10% of his starting class went on to finish . Most opted for the masters and went on to teach . Yes, our son almost didn't make it and suffered emotionally. Harrowing comes to mind"
chet brewer,"the difference between 1978 and 2020 in education is pretty extreme. I got my masters in physics in 1978 and it required me to be in class a couple of times a week. My wife got her masters in tax at the University of Baltimore in 2017 and skyped her classes about 75% of the time and went in at the end of the semester for a single exam.   You simply date yourself as completely out of touch with how education has changed, Personally i thought sitting in class was often a waste of time and having to drive from work to class was a pain. My wife survived tax season as a cpa by having a remote option. A doctorate still requires a dissertation or capstone project.  I would have killed to have a remote option"
Gary Hale,"Great editorial - if you're writing for the Mayberry RFD Times in the 1950's.  Otherwise it's just jealousy, chauvinism or stupid politics to compare titles of a man with a Bachelors or Honorary degree (Mister) to a woman earning a Doctorate (Doctor).  "
Don Pettengill,"This is a cultural thing. I have a Ph.D. in Physics. When I was at work in that field, I was ""Dr."", even in the US. Outside work, it's ""Mr."", and that is the norm for the US.  In Europe, especially Germany, it's different: my Lufhansa card has me as ""Dr."". But even in the US, there are exceptions to the rule: ever hear anything other than ""Dr. Henry Kissinger"" ? The difference? The outsize influence of the AMA; and more importantly, the attitude of the common man here:  no formal respect to other, equal - in the eyes of God and the state - men. So ""Dr."" is reserved for someone to call during a medical emergency (""is there a Doctor in the house?""). And, it's MISTER president.  Ed.D. s or Ph.D.s who insisted on the ""Dr."" title in normal life were  mocked and called pretentious. Jill Biden should drop it. The honorific in the US is by custom reserved for use while at work. And we already saw one famous TV idiot suggesting ""Dr. Jill"" for surgeon-general.  Give me a break."
BEN OLIVAS,"This is a an unfortunate rant by an insecure underachiever who enviously views excellence from the outside.  That he has only a bachelor's degree nor the fact that he is not Phi Beta Kappa is not the issue.  Many people have achieved career happiness and personal fulfillment with those things, but this old curmudgeon clearly has not.  May he find solitude in his desolation.  "
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.In an alternate universe where the 2020 US President elect were not a senile fool,  the intellectual pretentions of his DrEd wife would not be a big deal.In our universe, Dr. Jill might be our Acting President."
P Lee,"I thought these kind of publicity stunts only belong to magazines you would see in grocery stores. While I do appreciate WSJ for its quality reporting and contents, this piece has been a disappointment. Having voted for Trump twice, I do not like the result of 2020 election, however, I will respect whoever occupies the White House in 2021. This is just a low ball blow to Dr. Jill Biden.  Leave the family alone and criticize Biden's policies. "
Rose O'Connor,I am only a recent WSJ subscriber and have been wholeheartedly unimpressed by its quality thus far. This piece is truly appalling; it is as misogynistic as it is inane. The editors should be ashamed of themselves for running it.
LOUIS CIOLA,"Doctorates of Education are a curious bunch.  Don't forget Bill Cosby has an Ed as well.  They all seem to have a direct pipeline to the Almighty   But, if Jill Biden, Dr. Jill Biden wants to continue to use the term Doctor she's welcome to it.  But, a doctorate in Education is in reality not the heavy duty degree an M. D. degree is.    If our first lady has a doctorate in Education you can be sure that everything will be exactly just so, almost as bad as if she had a degree in Social Work.   Just teasing of course.   She will make a perfect match for her husband, the Reverend Joe Biden,  Billy Graham incarnate.  Everything will be so politically correct you won't be able to stand it. "
chet brewer,"hey at least she has earned her own way in life, i guess actually working for a living is something you trump supporters  hate, you prefer women who make their living with their looks and body  and men who inherited their wealth and relied on their father to keep from going bankrupt. "
Mike German,"Now, now, Chet, no need to drag VP Harris or Hunter Biden into this."
LOUIS CIOLA,"Maybe the Reverend Joe Biden's wife ought to teach Hunter Biden about the ten commandments.  You know, the one about ""Thou shalt not covet they neighbor's wife?""  He left his own wife and children for his brother's widow and then after two years dumped her for another woman. The Reverend Joe Biden and his wife the Dr. Jill are two consummate hypocrites.. They are every bit as mean spirited and crooked as Trump only they keep it more on the down low.  I don't care if she works for a living or not.  An Ed.D  is certainly not in the same league as an M.D. degree.   Bill Cosby has an Ed.D and we all know what a hypocrite he was Mr. Family man never using an off color word in his act, all the while drugging women for his own enjoyment. Trump won the White House under his own power..  His father was dead when he ran for office.  No one handed that to him, he won it fair and square.  And, for four years the Democrats tried to rewrite the voters  wishes.. "
PARUL JAIN,Why is the WSJ even putting out stupid and self-serving articles like this? Quite silly and ridiculous!
Mac Moore,"Too funny!  Apparently diversity is not something that appeals to you.  Try MSM or a college campus, they don't allow diversity of thought."
Vijay Singh,"This column is not about Jill Biden. It is about this Epstein dude.He wants us to know that despite having only an AB ( and so smart - he got it by taking the final exam on the pool table, no less) he was considered good enough to teach at Northwestern. Which of course puts him at par with the other world renowned  professors there.  Despite that he does not care to be called Dr. ( other than the fact that he does not have a doctorate - minor details I guess) And Jill Biden - well she can't hold a candle to him cause she taught at  a community college (and of course her doctorate was in a soft discipline)  but her arrogance knows no bounds. How dare this 'kiddo'  use the honorific  Dr. when the great man Epstein has chosen to eschew it."
Mac Moore,"Singh writes, ""How dare this 'kiddo'  use the honorific""Epstein didn't make that term up, silly.  Joe, as his normal method of addressing women, patronizes his wife with ""doctor Biden"" and, then, at other times, belittles her with ""kiddo"".  "
LILBURN T,"One thing that differentiates the WSJ EB from other those of other editorial pages is a smugness - that their contrarian views are somehow superior to the earnest ""mainstream media "".  (Kimberly Strassel, Daniel Henninger, Im talking about you!) But this article will go down in history as both the very worst and the most emblematic of the EB's smug complacency. I hope some EB intern is reading this and passes this along to your superiors:  Henceforth, too many (many many many) readers, anything that the WSJ EB decides to print will be indelibly marked: oh, yes, these opinions come the same people that published the Epstein piece.  "
Mac Moore,"lILBurnt writes, ""Henceforth, too many (many many many) readers, anything that the WSJ EB decides to print will be indelibly marked: oh, yes, these opinions come the same people that published the Epstein piece.""Exactly.  Unlike the NYT, LAT and Time magazine, where diversity of opinions is forbidden, the WSJ does, indeed, publish many differing opinions.  Sometimes, even Obama gets published.  For those that have difficulty with diversity of opinions, there is always the MSM and even a college campus."
William Rainey,"I generally agree that the term Dr. being confined to those in the medical field. But the term kiddo showed a sexist and demeaning tone, perhaps  colored by the author  being in academia and  seeing a lot of stuffy people with doctorates and the ultimate form of union protection, tenure."
Doodle Dad,"While I agree with your view of this Epstein guy, who are you - or anyone else, to deny someone who earned a Doctorate the Dr. term?"
P Curr,"A US citizen, I assume which allows us to ignore any and all titles of nobility.  You can't force someone to call you by a title.  It's in the Constitution..."
Mac Moore,"Rainey writes, "" But the term kiddo showed a sexist and demeaning tone, perhaps.. ""Agreed.  Joe Bidem. as his normal method of addressing women, patronizes his wife with ""doctor Biden"" and, then, at other times, demeans her with ""kiddo"".  So, I am sure that you have voiced your concern, as the author does here, about Joe's bad manners."
Matt Walker,Then why don't we call people with law degrees Dr.?
Vijay Singh,Because they do not have a Ph.D.
Mac Moore,"Singh writes, ""Because they do not have a Ph.D.""Neither does Biden.  So, now, what?"
Sarah Hager,it's a 3 year program with no dissertation.
PETER DYKE,"Oh, but many lawyers ARE Drs. - doctors of jurisprudence . (like R.M. Nixon, ""we're all Keynes-sians, now!""). "
PETER DYKE,"p 2Oh, but many lawyers ARE Drs. - doctors of jurisprudence . (like R.M. Nixon, ""we're all Keynes-sians, now!""). Or, ""every man a King"". Except Dr. Doolittle - he's a ""provider"", now, (Mr. H. Lofting) "
patricia hubbard,I'm stunned that the WSJ would print such an archaic piece. Sounds like the drivel that I and other women suffered in the 1960s and 70s. Poor Joseph Epstein. He has been left behind in a cloud of dust.
Kip Krumwiede,This is a terrible and sexist article.  PhDs are Doctors!!
Mark Sellke,Tom here.Jill does not have a PhD.
Vijay Singh,Ed.D is the same thing.
Mac Moore,"Singh writes, ""Ed.D is the same thing""Really?  So, she has a Ph.D.?  When did that happen?"
Doodle Dad,"Dr. Jill Biden received a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in educational leadership from the University of Delaware. Can you read ""D-o-c-t-o-r"" in her degree? Who are you to remove her off her hard-earned degree?"
Mac Moore,"Dad writes, ""Can you read ""D-o-c-t-o-r"" in her degree? Who are you to remove her off her hard-earned degree?""Most lawyers have the same term in their degrees, as well.  Now, what?"
Bob Wakefield,The author displays little tact.the very last sentence is especially bad.
Vijay Singh,The only thing amazing here is the WSJ editorial staff's decision to print this stuff.   Must be hard times.
Mac Moore,"Singh writes, ""The only thing amazing here is the WSJ editorial staff's decision to print this stuff.   Must be hard times.""Well, it must certainly be hard times for those that can't handle diversity of opinions.  Maybe, a college campus, NYT, LAT or Time magazine, where diversity is not allowed, would be better for your sensibilities."
Steve Weinstein,"Add me to the list of those who've cancelled their subscriptions over this op-ed. Bye, y'all. It's been real. "
Neena Kumar,"This isn't well written, stinks of chauvinism, and is just plain mean! I have a PhD & for sure people seek my help because I studied longer and know more. I don't get it - you jab at education and expertise and yet would you seek out an expert during an urgent matter?  Or someone who just took a shot in the dark? All day we hear from psychologists, epidemiologists, chemists, etc about the pandemic and vaccines.  All these people are PhD's and are the reason you have the help that is coming.  . Its not unusual they study for a decade and become doctors in their field.  If you do not like it its too bad.  Its SOP.   Standing on your pedestal  jeering at those around you comes off as petty, ill spirited and lacks any integrity or rigor.  WSJ - really?  You can do better."
Mac Moore,"Kumar writes, ""This isn't well written, stinks of chauvinism, and is just plain mean!""So, you agree that Joe Biden's effort to patronize his wife with Doctor Biden, while at the same time, demean her with his pet name, ""kiddo"" is chauvinism and just plain mean?  Good for you.  The author's point is well made."
Ray Hull,"To supplement that headline, it might be noted that the President's personal Doctor is of Osteopathy."
Charles Barr,Osteopaths are fully qualified 'physicians' who are licensed to prescribe medication and perform surgery in the United States. 
Richard Reich,The entire practice of granting/retaining titles of state after a person has left office should be dropped.  Most of them never deserved the title to begin with.
Eric Alan Isaacson,"Mr. Epstein asserts that honorary doctorates must be worthless because they've been awarded to African American women. That's racist, as well as sexist.  The WSJ should be ashamed of itself for publishing his racist misogynistic rant. "
Kelly Essman,Perhaps Mr. Epstein hopes to receive a degree from Trump University? 
Jennifer Hatcher,Doctorates are being dumbed down.  You can even get one online.  Teachers in Georgia get them to increase their pay.  The author of this article has a point.
Vijay Singh,Hers was not online.  I am sure she is referred to as Dr. or Professor Biden  at the college she teaches.  There is nothing wrong with being referred to as Dr. Biden.
Ilya Shlyakhter,"If his point had been that ""Doctorates are being dumbed down"", and he focused on concrete evidence of that, he'd have a point.   But per the article's title, its point is as a hit piece on a specific person."
Stephanie Loomis,"Wait, what? You have a ""only a B.A. in absentia"" and you are therefore qualified to pass judgement on the value of a degree because you don't think the curriculum arduous enough?  I don't know HOW this nonsense got past the editors, but I assure you that your four years of higher education  affords you no credibility for your assumptions. I will ignore your ""honorary"" title; these are often handed out like Turkish Delight on the White Witch's sleigh.  I will not ignore your claim that  Doctor of Philosophy degrees  are without rigor, fear, terror or pain. I earned one, and when I say I earned it, I mean I took the hard courses, did the research, wrote a 300+ page dissertation and defended it before elite scholars. The standards  are still arduous. Ed.D. candidates also complete research, dissertations, and defenses. The honorific is earned, not bestowed. And, just to avoid the ""pandering"" label, I am a conservative who did not vote for Biden (or Clinton, or Carter, for that matter.)"
Vijay Singh,In Epstein's own mind his BA in absentia is better than any doctorate from MIT ( other than than the one obtained Trump's uncle) 
Betsy Moody,"I do have the MD, but this ""opinion piece"" was outrageous--I highly respect those who have toiled and achieved the honor of an earned PhD.  And I only ""delivered"" one baby--oh,  but I was just a medical student--I basically just caught the baby, and I realized that pretty much the woman in labor was the one who actually delivered the baby!  And if you are female, even with the MD, there are many times in the medical setting when it is assumed you are the assistant or the secretary.  And times when the nurse is male and the patient calls him doctor--a male nurse with whom I worked in an ER (a great nurse, and I highly respect all of them for what they are doing on the front lines now!) and I would chuckle and gently point out the error.  Perhaps this author's ""honorary PhD"" should be withdrawn, for he certainly has no honor!"
John Jones,Another fake controversy created to criticize a good woman for using a title that she earned. Ridiculous.  
David Schmidt,The fake controversy is the exact opposite of what you think. 
David Schmidt,I wonder how good Dr. Jill is at diagnosing cognitive decline in her spouse. It will require compassion for his welfare and protection from challenging and embarrassing exposure to critics. 
W Kroll,Do you believe that Dr. Jill Biden has compassion in her? 
David Schmidt,"I honestly don't know. But I would say that if he is suffering a significant decline, she would be the first to know. And if so, apparently wanting him to be president would not be in his best interest. "
Monte Abbott,Most people are missing the larger context of this opinion piece.Jeffrey Epstein occasionally writes opinion pieces claiming academics make too much money and do too little work. He spent 30 years teaching college classes as a lecturer at low pay because he never achieved a degree beyond the bachelor level. Context is usually important. 
Steve Weinstein,"After reading this, I think I understand why he never got anywhere in Academia. "
David Schmidt,It's Joe Epstein. I think his real first name means a lot more than the title. 
Barbara Boyd,"What utter drivel. He complains about people who were bestowed an honorary degree using the honorific , then twists that to suggest that Jill Biden is not entitled to use the title that she EARNED. "
Alan Bernstein,"I had a boss once who got a Ed. D. She, too, liked to hear herself titled Dr.  Everyone saw it as pretentious and bogus. She was ridiculed behind her back. "
M. Evans,"More of this, please!"
jason gettinger,"I sympathize with Mr. Epstein on account of the slings and arrows he has received for this drole essay.  Far from sexist, for he calls upon all Phds to abjure using the Dr. honorific, it states what was once a truth:  in English speaking countries, those with academic, not medical, doctorates were addressed as Mister or Miss.  At Cornell, a relatively new university, it was assumed that all full professors, associates and even assistant professors had the Phd in their field.  We addressed them as Mister.  On my wall here are two MD degrees from Cornell,  father's and  grandfather's.  I could have exchanged my Columbia LLB for a Juris Doctor, but I didn't.  In any event, it might still be a violation of the canon of ethics for a lawyer to refer to herself as Doctor; this is a no, no unless one holds the advanced degree of Doctor of Judicial Science -- something most law professors don't hold.  My father told me in  German speaking lands, one can be Her Doktor, Doktor if one has two."
Sarah Hager,The three-year Juris Doctor degree isn't comparable because lawyers don't go through a research program and produce a dissertation. 
jason gettinger,"Technically that is true, but the JD idea came up because many thought that the research and writing requirements were the equivalent of the work for a PHD (never mind Ed D).  Law school is about learning how to do research.  I tend to agree with you, however, because the PHD thesis is an original work.  As I say above, I never sent in for a JD, not even after my Columbia LLB diploma was lost in the wreckage of 7 World Trade Center.  I got a new LLB, in Latin, with the date of my graduation, but machine signed by the dean of the Law School and the University President in 2002.  Moreover, Mr. Gigot says the WSJ style book agrees with me and Mr. Epstein."
Roger Barnaby,"Gawd, I left the WSJ 6 months ago because of fluff opinion pieces like this, filled with resentment, jealousy, and grievance.  I resubscribed just a week ago, now I'm thinking of canceling once more.Roger Barnaby, Ph.D. (Geology, Virginia Tech, 89)"
George Ciganik,Yes doctor - give me a break!
David Schmidt,Literally no one cares whether you subscribe or not. 
Jeffrey Hoeber,Triggered?
David Schmidt,"Nah just amazed at how many folks commenting here think their outrage will legitimately hurt the WSJ. Also, the cancel culture is so active on Twitter today that no doubt hundreds or thousands of subscribers have rush to comment here to put the kibosh on Epstein. But I digress. "
Jeffrey Hoeber,Sounds like denial to me
P Curr,"They're shocked! Shocked to find opinions in an opinion piece....so shocked they must opine on the shock they've experienced,"
Christina Rodriguez MBA,"I do!  I just need 4000 more replies to start shorting the stock, price is already declining and will open lower on Monday.  If universities which currently require students to subscribe also decide to boycott WSJ then the editors were in on this and it's a market manipulation.  This story has gone viral.  *News Corp on Nasdaq."
David Schmidt,"The NYT can be brow beaten into firing editors for not falling in line with woke culture, but not the WSJ. This publication has a long history in caring more about diversity of opinion. Your efforts to cancel them will be wasted. "
Jeffrey S,"So, people are cancelling subscriptions over this. Yeh, it is a silly article, with someone who has I guess PH.D envy. Look, if wants to write an essay on the doctorate system that is his right. However, the way he does so in this essay so focused on Jill Biden and doctorates outside of the world of medicine is sign of truly small thinker. Given, what has been written on Covid-19 in these opinion pages, this is just silly nonsense in line with a lot of silly pieces that get printed in the Opinion section. This paper may be the newspaper of record as to financial news, but not much else."
David Flaherty,This rag won't be getting my money much longer if they are going to act like one of these right wing conbarts.
Ian Williamson,"My father earned his Ed.D. back in the late '70s.  People referred to him as ""Dr."" for pretty much his entire career in education, education policy and consulting.  To my knowledge, nobody ever suggested that he should shrink from being referred to as ""Dr."" because of the existence of honorary doctorates (which neither he nor Dr. Biden have - both earned their degrees).The key difference here, of course, is that my father is a conservative man and not a woman. "
David Schmidt,"No, the key difference is Jill Biden doesn't have a job in education. "
Masengo Kapanga,Except she does- she's an actual educator.
David Schmidt,She was. She is First Lady elect now. Time to lose the pretentious title. 
Lisa Ellern-Feldman,This seems to be the editors attempt to appeal to the Trump base.  They aren't buying your papers boys.  
BRET STEWART,David Schmidt seems to be one of them who is.  He is replying to every post on this thread with talking points from Hannity/Carlson/Ingraham.
Deborah Carlston,"So, Joey, when is the WSJ going to fire you and hire a competent journalist to replace you?"
Anne Deupree,"In 2009  the outgoing 2nd lady, Lynne Cheney had a PHD and several scholarly publications, and to my knowledge never insisted on being called ""doctor.""  I thought it striking that the incoming one, Jill Biden, had an EdD. , and did insist of being called ""doctor.""  It seemed to show some insecurity on her part.Also, I've been reading and mostly enjoying Joseph Epstein's essays for years  I always figured he was an ornament to Northwestern rather than the other way around."
Maxwell Kearns,"You can almost see Mr. Epstein (or should I drop the ""Mr"" since honorifics are too much for him...) squirming at the thought of a woman with a higher degree than him. This article drips with misogyny, and the contempt this author holds for educated woman is blaringly obvious. A disappointing read from the WSJ."
M. Evans,I loved it! Shoulda been read on SNL. 
Daniel M,"Since we're discussing honorifics, about we refer to the author as ""Epstein, B.A.  (in absentia)."" "
Rachel Grantham,"Wow! A male writer I have never heard of decides it's time to question academic titles in general in an incoherent op-ed based on the fact that an important woman has one, rightfully earned at an accredited university.  Wall Street Journal, seriously?"
David Schmidt,Joe Epstein has been on the op ed pages of the WSJ numerous times. You obviously don't read much of the Opinion pages. Twitter must have sent you here today. 
Rachel Grantham,"Haha, true enough!  Judging from this article, I guess there's a reason I haven't been paying attention."
Monte Abbott,"Our country is falling apart as Republicans attempt to destroy our election system. Almost 300,000 of us are dead thanks to a botched pandemic response (to severely understate the situation).Meanwhile, Joseph Esptein, BA, regales us with this koffeklatch-style kvetching about something that is not important. I want my 5 minutes back. "
Michael Hal,Cancelling subscription now.  The continued disrespect for intelligence and hard work is shameful. 
M. Evans,"oh, this made me sign up!"
SARA SOTO,The WSJ's willingness to publish opinion pieces like this is the reason my subscription will not be renewed next month. 
john ridilla,"After reading this article, so many thoughts come to mind , mostly pure outrage at  Mr. Epstein for his condescending , mightier than thou tone.   But I am not sure if I am more disappointed in the BS that was written or the fact that the Wall Street Journal printed it.   "
robert wechsler,"If Mr. Epstein's characterization of Doctor=MD not Ph.D. , then maybe we should re-examine attorney=esquire. I haven't seen too many lawyers running around escorting knights of the realm  or bearing a knight's shield. That is what an esquire did.Dr. Biden earned her degree and can choose whatever appellation she wants. By the way, it's incredibly condescending to refer to her as Dr. Jill. No one I know refers to me as Dr. Bob.Robert Wechsler, Ph.D."
Mary Garcia,"I realize this is the opinion page, but what an insult to teachers and educated professionals who worked and earned their PhD. Where does the author get off thinking that HE (a person with only an honorary PdD) has the authority to pen a petty, misogynistic editorial in the Wall Street Journal? Not a text to a friend, or a tweet or a Facebook post - his opinion is so important he's taking it straight to the WSJ. He's so full of his self importance, so personally offended, that he's compelled to whip off this complaint because Dr. Jill Biden dares to want to continue using her title?  And then he mocks the subject matter of her dissertation because it addressed the importance of retaining students at the community college level? Hey, Jeffrey - your age, gender and privilege is showing.  It's about time you and your ilk sit down and shut up already. "
Nate Gillman,"When a person is going to disparage a member of another group, it usually helps their case when they're actually a member of that same group. An illustrative example is The Lincoln Project--they made waves because they were a group of establishment Republicans seeking to undermine the current Republican standard bearer. In contrast, Epstein's argument here reads as follows: ""universities hand out honorary doctorates like candy on Halloween. I should know, as I got one and certainly didn't deserve one. In conclusion, Jill Biden's degree is worthless.'' This argument is completely devoid of logical merit or even consistency, and this is made even worse by Epstein's condescending tone and blatant misogyny.  Referring to a 69-year old women as ""kiddo""? Claiming that one should only call themselves ""Doctor"" if he (note the author's choice of pronoun) delivered a child? To quote the president-elect out of context, I retort: ""C'mon, man."""
David Schmidt,Was your use of the Lincoln Project as an example intended to be ironic?
Jim Kearney,"Wow. Dumb. But at least condescending, so solid work."
Alan Meltzer,the outrage is not Dr. Biden's title; it's the thinly veiled misogyny of this column's writer.https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/dr-jill-biden-wall-street-journal/2020/12/13/e43883a4-3d45-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html
Maureen DiRienzo,"Repeating an earlier post- At one time the world's leading scholar of Shakespeare was a professor at Harvard. He had a master's degree.  His PhD colleagues urged him to go get a PhD somewhere.  His reply, ""Under whom would I study?""Sometimes you don't need a PhD when you are able to teach yourself.  Maybe Mr Epstein with his lowly BA found that to be true too."
jason gettinger,"I admire U Chicago.  I didn't attend.  An AB from there is worth more than many higher degrees from some pretty well-known places.  It may be where fun goes to die, but it is serious."
Mary Ellen Stoykov,"Maybe not.  It's a very poor argument that Mr. Epstein makes.  I have an ""honorary doctorate"" so Dr. Biden  who earned her doctorate should not be called Dr.?  Maybe if he tried to get a PhD, he would be able to make a logical argument.  Then again, maybe he does not have the persistence needed to actually finish a doctoral degree."
P Harris,Dr. Pepper sends his love :smile:
Francis Beaudoin,I have rarely read a piece as dumb. It screams misogynistic resentment.  Man up dude.  
JOAN Ogden,"I receive The Wall Street Journal though membership in my professional association, and access to the American Scholar (referenced by the author above) through having been inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.  Prior to moving into my current profession, I spent several years in academia, where the term ""Dr."" is routinely used for someone with a doctoral degree.   The author indicated he taught at the college level without an advanced degree.  I must presume his so noting was to diminish the title most of his then colleagues had.  In academia, we referenced non-advanced degree teachers as ""teaching assistants"" (if  working toward an advanced degree), or Instructors, if not active students.  I find myself wondering whether the above suffers ""title envy"".  I am perplexed as to whether the author is ineffectually attempting at humor (kiddo?), and whether by said editorial, The Wall Street Journal tacitly conveys disrespect for Dr. Biden.  As a professional and a female, I find both inexcusable!  "
David Schmidt,"I have two brothers with Ph.Ds and apparently unlike Jill Biden, their ego doesn't depend on others calling them Doctor. This feigned outrage is ridiculously stupid. "
Charles Barr,"I have a brother-in-law with a Phd in Physics.  I believe the only time he uses the title Dr. is when he goes to conferences.  I am sorry to say that he's real smart, but he is an ardent Democrat. "
Monte Abbott,"Why do you think Jill Biden's ego ""depends on"" others calling her Doctor?Don't you have better things to rage about?"
David Schmidt,"Uh, sir, this is not rage. Frankly all the outrage I see here today is comedic.  Don't you have better use of your time than to misinterpret my interest in this topic? Seriously, why should it matter to Jill Biden or her defenders if her ego weren't at stake? Or to put it another way, who cares?"
Lou Con,Bill Cosby had a doctorate  in education  too.
Linda Titus,"An MD is an MD.  A doctor is doctor.  We refer to therapists, veterinarians, and dentists as doctors, too. The real problem is that Mr. Epstein has earned none of these credentials.  Jealousy is so unbecoming!  I have an honorary MA.  What did I do to earn it?  NOTHING!  Honorary degrees are just that: honorary.  I worked hard to earn an actual MA and PhD.  So you can call me doctor, Mistah!"
David Schmidt,I'll think about it Linda. 
Deborah Hartman,"Now I know why my new subscription offer was priced so low, kiddos. "
Journal of Accountancy,"This is just a really stupid piece for the WSJ. She earned a doctoral degree, which means she can (and should) use Dr.  Tell educators and scientists across America not to use Dr.  See if they agree."
Dan R,"As long as she is speaking to her own Ed.D. recipients, none of which would be considered scientists in any scientific community.  "
Monte Abbott,"There are also Doctor's of Divinity and Philosophy.""Doctor"" is not solely an appellation in the sciences. "
David D BRINSON,What a total lack of class.  I'll chalk it up to Mr Epstein's advanced age and senility.
Cindy Fryman,"The doctor thing is OK, I guess.  Just look for  the media to swoon over everything Biden.  They can't let us see that they propped up mediocrity during the campaign.Tom F"
Michael Hal,Kiddo?Rather demeaning unless I am missing something?I guess the WSJ is really looking to concentrate its readership...
Mary Davis,"Absolutely. Why dilute its readership with articulate, classy, sophisticated, and progressive views?"
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.Is Dr. Jill doing strategic preparation for a catfight with Kamasutra? Quoting a tweet:Mark Krikorian

That will make it harder for Harris to 25th-Amendment him, since she'd need a majority of the Cabinet to vote her way."
Heidi Baxter,"When I was a young person starting my career in the financial services industry back in the 80s the Journal was considered the gold standard of journalism and a revered institution. My god how far it has fallen; people are dying by the thousands each day, the economy is devastated  and this is what you choose for your latest editorial screed? Where is your gravitas WSJ? Pathetic. I will be canceling my subscription post haste. I can read this trash for free on Fox News. "
S Simon,"I'll tell you what WSJ. This editorial is so ill-mannered, so politicized, so degrading to women who achieve difficult professional pursuits as to be misogynistic. Frankly it is beneath the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. So I'm going to cancel my subscription immediately. What kind of myopia encourages such an opinion piece to be published? And in the end the author in the most imperious manner tells Dr. Jill Biden to drop her title and just enjoy living in ""public housing"". How much more insulting can one get? With all the very important things to write about in these dark and desperate days, this is what the WSJ chooses to publish. More and more bottom feeding since the Trumpification of the national dialogue."
Bill Mager,So the WSJ thought it was a good idea to publish this because____ ?
EC Henley,"Lighten up people.  Apparently many did not actually read the article as Ms Dr Biden did not earn a PhD degree, but earned a doctorate in education, an EdD....the two are quite different.  The point of this article is the proliferation of credentials and the silly use of the honorific in non academic settings. Were Ms Dr Biden speaking at a scholarly meeting of educators, her honorific title would appropriately be used.  The decline in educational rigor to earn degrees is a serious problem, but a subject for another day. "
Jerome Abernathy,""" The point of this article is the proliferation of credentials and the silly use of the honorific in non academic settings.""No, the article was mean, nasty and demeaning.  To quote Mr. Epstein:""Any chance you might drop the ""Dr."" before your name? ""Dr. Jill Biden "" sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware through a dissertation with the unpromising title ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs.""""Fraudulent?  Comic?  Unpromising?  Mr. Epstein needs to be shown the door."
Mary Davis,I believe Mr. Epstein has shown his true colors.
Donna Maria Ticchi,"I agree completely with your comment, EC.  I would  add that the inflation of graduate degrees in education is likely in direct proportion to the failure of our public schools to teach students .  Back when I was in primary and secondary school, our public school teachers did not have fancy degrees, but they knew how to  teach  their students the basics.  If the public schools  were doing their jobs properly today, community college would not be required as a necessary remedial action."
Ilya Shlyakhter,"If ""The point of this article is...the silly use of the honorific in non academic settings"", then why distinguish MDs?  How is that credential any more relevant in non-medical settings, than an Ed.D. in non-educational ones?"
Samantha Smith-Hartz,Did the WSJ acquire the Onion?
David Reams,"No, the Onion acquired the WSJ."
Daniel M,"The author only holds a B.A. in absentia?  He's fortunate to have been born during the generation when an undergraduate degree was sufficient for doing well for one's self.  Plus, his prose in this article is rather choppy and does not flow well. How did this man establish himself as an author, and how did he manage to get published in the WSJ?"
LINDA V DELUCA,"I CANNOT believe the reaction to this article and the vitriol it has received.  When I read the article,  I saw it as a humorous lament on the dumbing down of our educational system, the  hrand the conceit of "

Maureen DiRienzo,"No sorry, you are now called a ""provider"".  Thank the insurance companies for that.  "
David Schmidt,That's Dr. Provider to you ma'am!
Joseph Wilson,This piece doesn't meet the editorial standards of the Wall Street Journal and should be removed.
Charles Barr,It's not an opinion of the Editorial Board of the WSJ.  It's an opinion of Joseph Epstein.
Robert Lichtenstein,The problem is it did meet the standards of the WSJ editorial page.
Teresa Hannah,"If getting a PhD is so easy, how come the author DOES NOT have one?"
David Schmidt,Maybe because it's not worth the paper it's written on?
ALAN WELLS,He saw the value proposition of an ed PhD and didn't take that route.  An undergrad math degree is more difficult than an Ed Phd.
Jerome Abernathy,"""An undergrad math degree is more difficult than an Ed Phd.""No, no it's not. "
M. Evans,Too funny!
Gary Fisher,Why did the WSJ EB print this condescending offensive piece?
Cindy Fryman,"Those should be reserved for the Trump family.Right, Gary?Tom F"
Charles Barr,Because she is pretentious?
Jeffrey Voigt,"The author does not have the standing to write this piece.   Someone who has earned a PhD could say you shouldn't put your Dr. before your name, but your basic makes you unqualified.  I have an MBA, and I don't question PhDs that I work with on whether or not they use their titles.  And the University of Northwestern so clearly stated.  The Department is aware that a former adjunct lecturer who has not taught here in nearly 20 years has published an opinion piece that casts unmerited aspersion on Dr. Jill Biden's rightful public claiming of her doctoral credentials and expertise. The Department rejects this opinion as well as the diminishment of anyone's duly-earned degrees in any field, from any university.Mr. Epstein, you are a hack,  and a sexist, and I wouldn't expect Northwestern to be calling you back anytime soon to teach or speak.  "
Stella Chan,"I understand that people can express their opinions based on their own preference and value system. However, I am bothered by the condescending tone of the author and the lack of solid arguments in the article . Mr. Epstein shows his ignorance of the origin and meaning of the title ""doctor,""  which, as one reader pointed out, means ""teacher,"" and it has been used since the 13th century for people who are awarded  doctorates. It is common, though not universal, for people who have earned the highest degree to include such title in their names or even official documents such as passports.  I am particularly disappointed that such an article is published in the Wall Street Journal. I expect writings and opinions like this to be found on Facebook or online blogs, not from a major national newspaper. "
Jim Orr,Have you ever read any of the other national newspapers opinion pieces?  I'm disappointed almost daily. 
Daniel M,"Stella, I wholeheartedly agree.  Life has been busy so I haven't had a chance to open the WSJ opinion pages in some time. This article was one of the first I've read since returning as an active WSJ reader. What an utter disappointment. The piece is dripping with jealousy and misogyny. The author should be ashamed for writing this, and the WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. "
howard nicols,"And this makes it to the wall street journal  --  it is not just honorary doctorates that have lost stature, dignity  and worth "
Jennie Stoltz,"This is misogynistic tripe. We all know that an article like this would never be written about the male spouse of a politician.  I realize that it's labeled ""opinion"" but if the WSJ is going to publish something this sexist then they had better print something to counter it very quickly. I already felt guilty enough about having a subscription. "
M. Evans,I assume you complained when Melania was treated the same way?
Jerome Abernathy,"""I assume you complained when Melania was treated the same way?""You mean when she was treated this way by Donald or someone else?"
Dan R,"I remember that there were so many pieces in media criticizing Ben Carson and ridiculing him for being called ""Doctor"" when he was appointed by Trump to be Secretary of HUD because it had nothing to do with his background as a surgeon.   I am sorry but the discussion of pretentious professional and educational titles of those in public political life is part of the political dialogue.  "
Linda Titus,What's pretentious about an actual title?  Nothing.  
Dan R,"Linda, when I taught at a university, there were students who called me ""Doctor"" even though that sounded to me pretentious and I did not encourage it.  But outside of my work and in social and community settings or in my wife's work-related social functions, I never let anyone call me  ""Doctor"" because it is in plain and simple pretentiousness.  "
Gina Ravosa,"Our new First Lady will always be DR. BIDEN to me.  As a medical doctor, I am pleased that she uses this designation - she earned it just the way I did.  DR. BIDEN is smart and accomplished; we should all be thrilled to have her as a role model for the girls and women of our country."
Dan R,"Gina, there are more women now entering medical school than men.   Maybe it is time not to be so obsessed with one's gender finally.  "
Brian Kearns,"Biden Derangement Syndromebegun already? He hasn't even won the Electoral College voteheck, Trump might still win, right?"

David Schmidt,Don't let the door slam on your way out. 
oleh sharanevych,Epstein get a life and stay away commenting .you should be fired.
Donald Wallace,Rand  Paul doesn't seem to require that he be called Doctor and he is a physician . I like that humility and most medical doctors( and osteopaths)  don't get concerned about titles outside of the professional life. 
JESSE SHAPIRO,Using Rand Paul and humility in the same sentence was good for a laugh.
Brian Kearns,"Rand Paul was awarded his doctorate by an organization that he heads.In other words, he is not a real doctor"
Maureen DiRienzo,"Dr Paul is an ophthalmologist, an MD specializing in eyes.  "
Brian Kearns,"Rand Paul, the eye doctor turned Republican Senate candidate in Kentucky, may not be a ""board-certified"" ophthalmologist, as he reportedly claimed. Paul's certification comes from a board he incorporated and heads, but he hasn't been certified by an organization recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties for five years"
Donald Wallace,Then he shouldn't have provided free eye surgery for domestic and foreign patients if he isn't a real doctor. Board certification is not always required to practice and not possessing it doesn't mean you are not a doctor of medicine .
howard nicols,"having heard rand paul's medical views through the pandemic, his humility is well earnedsilence might be better"

jayk Briha,"Absolutely bad for WSJ to publish this opinion, but consistent with WSJ's double standards "
Federico Ruanova,Mr. Epstein: Really?  I fail to understand why you would raise this issue and criticize Jill Biden's credentials.
David Schmidt,Maybe because she is so pretentious? 
Mark B,"hmm, so let's see...jill biden, who has a doctorate, asks to be called, ""doctor"":  REALLY BADdonald trump, a US president who's currently doing everything in his power to overturn our free elections & democracy -- who had someone take his SATs, got into college through nepotism, & never ran a business that didn't declare bankruptcy:  AWESOME.

Dan R,"hmm, so let's see...  Jill does not have a PhD now does she?"
Mark B,"brilliant. got me. makes all the difference.i could care less what people call her. personally think people with PHDs, etc are lame if they require people to call them ""doctor"". but imo not the point here..."
Brian Kearns,"Jill has a doctorate, she earned"
Mary Marsella,Brown suit. Never forget.
Lee BRENNAN,"Get over yourself Mr. Epstein.  She earned her title, just like her husband earned his presidency. Seems like sour grapes to me. "
jes merrell,"Anyone that had any, any, involvement in the development, approval and publication of this screed should be terminated with predjudice and their names and former positions listed on the front page. Just below an apology to Dr. Biden and a formal retraction and rejection of the ideas and language displayed by a senile and hateful, and obviously jealous author. "
Nicholas Greeson,"I'll buy into the watering down and lunacy of honorary degrees; but whether it's an MD, JD, DMA, or Ed.D, the title is earned. Degree farms maybe an issue, but they are an exception rather than the rule."
Joyce Griffin-Sobel,"What a fool.  Another threatened twit who couldn't finish his own PhD. What on earth was WSJ thinking by printing this garbage?  However, lets not forget how hard MD professional organizations have fought doctorally prepared nurses from using the title DR.  More misogyny.From a proud RN, PhD and Doctor."
J Zoll,Hey WSJ:  Could you provide the link to Epstein's similar previous column about Dr. Henry Kissinger.  I seem to be having trouble finding it.
Dan R,No such piece about Dr. Condoleeza Rice either just in case J Zoll happens to be implying something or is some kind of sexist police person.
Dan R,"What is your point?  There is no such piece about Dr. Condoleeza Rice either.  Both Rice and Kissinger are internationally recognized PhDs and true experts who applied their degrees to government work so they should have been called ""Doctor"" in that government context.  "
Thomas Freitas,The author should be complemented on his bravery. The expected outrage has arrived.
Dan R,A good opinion piece is one that promotes a diverse and large body of comments.  This was a great piece!  This is why I already really love WSJ as a new subscriber.   
DON MISENER,"The author is clearly envious.Jill Biden earned the term ""doctor"".The author did not.Sorry, not every kid gets a trophy."
Mark B,"1st, I think it's silly for people w/PHDs to ask others to call them ""Dr.""BUT, having said that, this piece is so moronically tone deaf, loaded with cliched male resentments, vapid -- & lacking in even a molecule of self-awareness -- that it encapsules perfectly the WSJ Opinion Page.  Sure, Let's talk about Jill Biden's ""title"" while our president, and virtually all Repub leaders, try to burn down our democracy.  Let's say nothing about the president's reprehensible actions. Let's collaborate with him -- it's what we do -- and instead focus on what really matters:    This Jill Biden PHD thing which, if left unaddressed, could be the end of...idiotic,    narcissistic, witless WSJ opinion commentary"
Jim Orr,"I agree with you the real news is not this op-ed piece about Joe Biden's wife,  but the investigation into Joe Biden's son.  Looking forward to more reporting and comments as these stories unfold.  Stay inquisitive. "
Margaret Schmid,"This is hilarious.  Kind of silly to nit-pick Dr. Jill (sans M.D.) on this point, but dear lord, the bits on the rich men, the falsely intelligent, the entertainers, and the simile for ""rarity"" is solid GOLD. "
Adrienne Wasserman,"I'm married to an astrophysicist, I ran a library for astrogeologists and astrophysicists, and none of them, male or female, of any age, ever called themselves ""Dr.""  And they use  PhD. after their name only where appropriate, maybe on a research paper, never, never on a letter to the editor.  That's considered very poor form.  The Wall Street Journal is right to tell Jill Biden to stop looking ridiculous, and people are royally tired of the kind of thin skinned nonsense that your articles has provoked."
Liana Pope,Pointless op-ed piece.  Sad that it was written in the first place...even sadder that the WSJ published it.  Subscription cancelled.  
ellen rankin,"I agree with you, Mr Epstein.Mrs Biden is pretentious and silly to keep calling herself Dr.Academic standards do not exist anymore, as well.Thank you."
Scott Warrender,"It would be challenging to begin an OpEd in a more condescending manner; you are only missing ""honey"" after kiddo and you would have nailed it.  Even if the reader agrees with the premise of your argument (and I doubt many care in the face of Covid, the economy and election insanity), your tone distracts from your point.  In 30 years in the hallowed grounds of academia, would figure that was a lesson you might have taught some of your students.  The again, those that can't...."

T Fowler,This is called an editorial? LOL No.  This is a misogynistic  diatribe from a man so enraged by a Democratic president-elect that he feels the need to attack his wife. Take those teary eyes to someplace like Daily Caller where they will be soothed by the inflamed fellow proud boyz.
Em Scally,"Whinier and whinier. That's the current state of WSJ editorializing. I remember the good old days when they had the talent, inclination and audience for serious discussion of the business and finance issues of the day. Now, a guy with an apparent chip on his shoulder because he never got a PhD has no more useful topic than a person with a doctorate calling herself a doctor.  I'm not a doctor but let me make one cut: Isn't Northwestern the lowest ranked school in the Big Ten. Maybe they should hire more PhD's."
Tapan Chakrabarty,"That WSJ will print an article demeaning the education of a woman, written by a man with questionable education ( BA earned in absentia) is shocking. But wait, isn't WSJ owned by a Murdoch organization that also owns a TV channel mired in sexual harassment scandal?"
Charles Swanson,"I used to look forward to essays by Epstein. But I fear that he is aging like fine wine...with a loose cork. And it's probably as small a point as his, but no adult should ever use ""kiddo"" with another adult."
Cindy Fryman,You are wound pretty tightly.  Pretend her last name is Trump.OK.  No problem.Tom F
Pete Marketos,"If her last name were ""Trump,"" the article would not have been written in Murdoch's WSJ."
Charles Swanson,"Tom, do Trump folks ever tire of whining?"
Michael Donato,An enormous abundance of pomposity below me here.
Robert Flournoy,"Those with dubiously earned Phd's that use the D word in front of their names are usually of low esteem and low productivity. The D helps define them not so much in the eyes of others but themselves.  For every MIT doctorate in Economics or M.D. awarded by John's Hopkins, a thousand are awarded by dubious programs that result in mostly entry level employment.  A Phd in education is not worth the paper it is printed on, but the million or so out there have wormed their way into public education, rotting it slowly but surely over the decades."
Jason Eriksen,"Oh, come on Bob; you sound a lot like someone who has no experience with our educational system. The US remains  a fantasic powerhouse of innovation, in part because of the world class quality of our educational system. The quality of our PhDs graduating every year is tremendous. We produce great  scholars in many fields. Elite leaders have come from nearly every accredited institution, and are not just found at Harvard, Yale, MIT, or Johns Hopkins."
Gregory Smith,Did Betsy ghost write this for you?
Steve Jensen,"I agree with Mr. Epstein here.  I want the journal to continue with contributing opinions such as this, along with articles on the other side if a good argument is to be made.  Enough with the attempted stifling of speech,  people.   Most secure people with a PHd don't go around insisting that people call them Dr.,  anyway...that's weird.  I don't see the ""sexism"" angle either.Keep up the good work,  WSJ.  I'm continuing with my subscription."
MICHAEL RUPP,I feel bad for the legitimate talented journalists who still work for this rag.  This disgraceful example of what the WSJ has become should be a sentinel event for all of you:  get out now and save your careers.
ADAM GARNER,"This op-ed is misogynistic trash and certainly not up to the WSJ's standards.  Why would the editorial board publish this drivel?  Long regarded as a right of center, but thoroughly principled, newspaper, I have become increasingly concerned that Journal's editorial board is beginning to gravitate to towards publishing the populistic, dystopian nonsense of various less-respected media outlets.   I read the Washington Post and the Journal because I know that both newspapers report the facts. The editorial board's on both predominantly centrist but with left-leaning slant at the Post and a right-leaning slant at the Journal.  Reading the editorials and opinion pieces in both papers provides the reader with a host of different views across the political spectrum.  Publishing garbage like this opinion piece takes away from the Journal's reputation as a credible and respectable news outlet. "
Danny Goodman,Epstein is Charmin soft for this.
Kevin Olson,"Biden's ""doctorate""  in a weak academic field is almost a pathetic as the Doctor of Nursing ""degree"" that too many hospital administrators flash around."
Nellie Burns,Have you ever looked at the requirements for a doctorate in nursing?  They're pretty darn intimidating.
Pam Pruyn,"Perhaps the writer, having NO credentials as a PhD of anything, is a wee bit jealous? Or perhaps, a wee bit misogynistic?Or perhaps had a slow day trying to find something scintillating to write about?This was not it.  Do you feel better now, Joseph?Now weren't YOU lucky to obtain a position at a prestigious university with NO credentials.  Scamming by with a lack of education is terrific. That means everyone should, no? After all, if YOU could do it, why bother doing the work to receive a PhD at all?Only someone with a BA in absentia (who also had to make sure he noted that he taught at Northwestern University....your insecure slip is showing..... or that you have been referred to as ""Dr"" as well)..(I  mean why would you bother stating YOUR credentials in the course of this opinion piece) would target a woman for having the outright nerve to be referred to by her title.  You are hilarious, self righteous, cavalier, and having an otherwise lackluster day at the office......"
Tom Maertens,"The WSJ editorial board has yet to address Trump's attempt to subvert the elections but has space for a dumb, sexist op-ed. "
Cindy Fryman,"Correct, Tom.  Disrespectful op-eds should be reserved for the Trump family,Tom F"
Chaz Palm,About 1/2 of those sharing their Doctorate with Bill Cosby and Jill Biden are more than ready to admit that it's not a 'real' doctorate but thanks to the power of the Teachers Unions it gives them vastly more 'step up' in salary AND even more importantly with retirement. The other half are...well...you know...
Debra Hartman,"This essay raises an issue which is obviously of great importance to the author, and probably not to many others. However, by using Dr. Jill Biden as his example, he certainly amplified his message.  Very clever. "
C Cotter,"Very ignorant, I'm sure you meant to say.  Comparing an advanced degree to an honorary degree is like comparing Trump to any good President - it just doesn't wash.  "
Nellie Burns,"I agree.  I have both.  One took my five years of hard work at incredibly low wages. The other was an honor, a great party, and free trip to Europe. And I don't know ANYONE who uses the honorific ""Dr."" if they only got an honorary degree.  "
Dr Miriam Hughes,"He certainly amplified his message all right - that he is an ignorant, sexist human being. "
Mary Costa,"This is Christine Moruza.  My mother received her PhD. from Columbia in 1956, back when it was difficult.  Although she had a full academic career in economics, she never insisted on being called ""doctor.""  Mr. Epstein is not misogynist--he is correct. Jill's insistence on the appellation is pretentious and tiresome."
Paul Degroot,"Note that the word ""doctor"" is derived from the latin verb ""docere,"" to teach.
Arguably, delivering a baby does not qualify one to call oneself a ""doctor,"" unless perhaps he/she is showing the dad how to do it himself next time.
It would be extremely difficult to argue that a teacher like Jill Biden, and especially an education professor--a teacher of teachers--is not a doctor. She's as qualified as it comes to carry the title."
C Cotter,"Exactly.  Actually, I belieev  medical doctors used to be called Misters (before women were trained as such), reserving the Doctor title for Professors."
Abbas K,"There are plenty of people who use the term Dr. when they have a Ph.D. Going after only one of them - a woman, an educator - is downright stupid and silly. As for Jill Biden, she is much more of a doctor than Jenna Ellis a ""Professor of Constitutional Law""- who dealt with traffic tickets before becoming the President's lawyer. I know WSJ editorials likes to throw some bones to stay in the news and make the ""libs"" angry. But there are plenty of substantive issues - this is just lazy. "
Chaz Palm,Really? Did you feel the same when Con Law Professor (HA!) Barack H Obama was paraded out for us to laud?
Maureen DiRienzo,"Ha yes, the ""Constitution scholar"" who never wrote a scholarly article and never argued a case in court.  Who was a non tenure track lecturer at U Chicago and was unknown to the faculty.  "
Chaz Palm,"Yes...THAT guy! (Also unknown, curiously, with classmates and professors at Columbia but....)"
Dr Miriam Hughes,"Mr Epstein your chances of actually achieving a PhD might be slightly increased if you knew the origins of the term ''doctor'' or if you do saw fit to pay attention to them.    I quote the Merriam Webster around the history of the word ''Doctor'' - please note that theologians and academics were the first to use it.   Yours sincerely - Another ''uppity'' woman with an earned Doctorate who uses her title...From Merriam Webster -  ""The word doctor comes from the Latin word for ""teacher,"" itself from docere, meaning ""to teach.""

The 14th century was the birth of the Renaissance, and lots of teaching and learning was afoot. By the century's end, the word doctor was being applied not just to a select few theologians, but also to qualified and/or accomplished academics and medical practitioners.  It's almost exclusively used of people now, and both qualified academics and medical practitioners may rightfully claim it."""
Ruben Avxhiu,"I don't mind Jill Biden using Dr. in front of her name. I like her a lot actually.Yet, I loved this article.The outrage over it made it even sweeter. Never change, WSJ. "
Kevin Burke,"Bravo, Mr. Epstein.  I subsribe to the American Scholar and have read many of your essays. In addition to honorary degrees, may I had another category of debased awards, the Pulitzers. You cannot be cancelled. Vasa vana plurimum sonant!"
P Harris,"Ubi dubium, ibi libertas."
Susan McCarthy,Boo WSJ and Joe.
David Bergstein,I honestly expect more from WSJ opinions than to publish this. Epstein's arguments add up to nothing more than personal attacks on Jill Biden and his all-too-obvious personal insecurity (likely from a career in pedigree-loving academia without a pedigree). WSJ editorial board: You can do better. Publish opinions with a bit more substance.
Mary Costa,"A ""doctorate"" in education?  And she needs to be referred to as ""Dr.?""  What a crock.  Education is the major for those who can't pass anything else, and a doctorate in the same is code for an empty head who wants a fat public salary. Jill is a shill for the teachers unions"", nothing more, and calling her ""Dr."" devalues the term for real doctors."
Tom Norris,"It's been a shame to see the steady decline of this editorial page since the Murdoch acquisition.  This is a new low, petty and pathetic."
James Holst,"Dear Mr. Epstein - Joey - Karen :  As you know from working in academia, earning a doctorate,  any doctorate is, expected, a solid amount of work, teaches you the proper way to run a study, helps you understand research, and has value in that community as a ""Union Card.""   I am sorry you did not earn this in your career and had to deal with your colleague's discrimination in reference to your own credentials.  Because let's face it, due to credentialism, you were not and are still not one of them.  Now, because of your own academic emasculation, you try to look smart by emasculating a liberal in a conservative owned publication through her title and an inferred weak doctorate.  Dr. Biden will be working in academia, has made that clear, and in the university environment she is Dr. Biden.  Funny how you did not mention this ""title issue"" 12 years ago when she was the VP's wife.  The reason is that it is not an issue just another example of conservative rhetoric .  Tootles Dr. Holst"
Robert Hammond,"Wow! A B.A., in absentia no less! Impressive! Certainly seems to qualify him to opine on the superior academic qualifications of others. A bit of envy, there, MISTER Epstein?"
Mary Costa,No one envies a doctorate in education.
Jim Orr,We should add Caregiver to her many titles. Maybe accomplice in the future too.
Richard Murphy,"When I was in grad school we didn't call the profs ""Dr.""  except on a few occasions.  My advisor, who was one of the top ten cited authors in the field, jokingly said that he always liked to call himself ""Dr. Professor. when getting restaurant reservations.""  In business, I worked with several Ph.D.s -- and no one called themselves Dr.  It would have been seen as pretentious -- you either did the job or you didn't but calling yourself Doc wasn't in the cards.  All the Ph.D's were male so it wasn't an issue of sexism.  Academics should refer to themselves as professor if they have a tenure track job.  And if they want to tack on Ph.D. at the end of their name, fine...but insisting that people call you doctor is ridiculous.  "
W Kroll,"Agreed with your point.  The main complaint here to which I would agree is the motivation for writing it in the first place. Unless there is some story out there of her being  pretentious about her name, I see no reason to bring it up in the first place aside from the goal of being petty. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"According to an earlier similar article in wash examiner, she insists on its use.  So, I agree, eye rolls all around."
Pam Pruyn,"That is your opinion. And you KNOW what they say about opinions, don't you?Luckily there others who do not feel the way you do, or who decide in what way people should refer to themselves. Women all over the country will take your ""opinion"" under advisement. "
Richard Murphy,"This isn't an issue related even remotely to sexism -- except perhaps to the  handful of left wing nuts who see something racist or sexist or genderist or homophobic -- give me a break.  Not anything I wrote has   anything to do with Jill Biden's gender.  It doesn't mean that Jill Biden didn't earn her Ed.D. or that she didn't write a dissertation.  But insisting on being addressed as Dr. and not clarifying that you are an Ed.D is simply pretentiousness.  But I suppose it's ok, after all Hunter Biden calls Joe -- The Big Guy -- and I'm sure he considers himself an honest businessman.  If you or any others who believe this article or my comment is sexist, please enlighten us.  The issue of the appropriateness of using Dr. -- has nothing to do with gender.  If someone wants to call themselves doctor and they've earned a doctoral degree, fine, but it is overly pretentious.  And regardless of history, today, when someone calls themself doctor, the assumption is they are an MD."
Ellen Willinghan,A wise [non-medical] Ph.D at Johns Hopkins once reminded me that an earned Ph.D requires contributing to the advancement of human knowledge.  A medical doctor only has to pass a series of tests.  
Brendan Keough,a comic crowning of credentialism.
Maryjanet Gillis,In a world where you can now self identify your gender/sexuality.....it seems pretty tame to use an honorific that you EARNED.  And maybe a case of sour grapes on author's part.
Darryl Bierly,"WSJ, you are a public disgrace with editorials such as this one, which make me seriously consider dropping my subscription on a regular basis. Please stick to your otherwise excellent *mostly* unbiased reporting of the factual news, and stop giving a voice to biased sexist spreaders of hate and misinformation like the author of this piece. What an ignorant rant."
Jeffrey Hall,"Well stated, ""Dr"" Epstien.  As an MD, married to an MD...with a daughter who is a Phd....I couldn't agree. more with your cynical assessment that the proffering of the title 'Dr' has become ""commonplace"" in our academic rigor.   We should reserve such titles to those who have earned them....Both at eh MD level, and at the rigorous Phd level.  "
MICHAEL RUPP,"Of the three of you, only your daughter merits the honorific term ""doctor"" which is derived from the Latin 'docere' (to teach).  Thus, physicians (the appropriate designation for you and your wife) appropriated a term that is not yours.Ask your daughter about it. Someone with an advanced graduate degree (which an MD is not) will confirm this."
Richard Murphy,"If Jill wants to call herself Dr., she should say Doctor of Education.  People can natter on about sexism etc., but there are good reasons why non med doctors shouldn't make a show of calling themselves doctor.

1)--there are a lot of schools that grant doctorates in all sorts of topics, and schools vary greatly in the quality of their doctoral programs.  Med schools may differ in their programs, but the variability isn't great -- and the quality of a medical education is highly influenced by the internships and residencies one gets.  Nowadays, you can get doctoral degree in something on-line.

2)  Med doctors have to be licensed to practice, academic do not with a few exceptions like clinical psych.  I don't believe Dr. Jill had to get a license.

3)  As noted you can get a doctorate in many topics, education is one of the lesser areas.  An Ed.D. from U Del v Ph.D. in astrophysics from Harvard? -- Jill should stick to using Jill Biden, Ed.D on formal letters."
Kieran Morrow,"It sounds like you're so flummoxed by non-physicians using the title ""Dr."" that you scheduled your most recent annual physical with a professor of English Literature instead of an internist. It must have been a surprise for all involved. I hope you get that sorted, and, in the meantime, consider using context clues."
Richard Murphy,"Gee, I'll have to remember your point.  So accurate.  What you''re missing is that she insists on people calling her doctor w/o context.  She should be clear that she is Dr. Jill Biden Ed.D.  The common usage of the title doctor refers to medical doctors, or dentists, perhaps clinical psychologists.  All require licenses and there are usually clear and common standards for all those who hold those degrees.  You refer to your primary care physician as your doctor but students at a college don't refer to those who teach them as doctors -- they say my prof(s) or teacher(s).I've thought for years that Dr. Jill was an MD.  There was no clarification in the news and certainly not from the Biden's.  I'm guessing that their hope is that people will think she made a fortune as an MD rather than through the family business."
patricia howell,"I have always looked forward to reading  Mr. Epstein's essays in the Journal.  He invariably hits the nail on the head, no matter the subject."
Quincy Harper,Oh yeah. He sure hit the nail on the blatantly misogynist and narcissistic head. Excellent observation Patricia. 
patricia howell,He called out her pretentiousness....and that is what it is.  I admire him for having done so.
PATRICK Woods,"From the position of BA in abstentia?   That is called sniffling jealousy.   If this guy taught at Northwestern for thirty years,  and never even bothered to get a tuition free Masters or two by taking a class here and there on the side, it doesn't say too much about his seriousness.  Maybe he trembles at the thought of another professor reading his thesis?   What does he teach anyway, Phys. Ed, yoga, pottery?"
John Capetta,"I suppose some progress, of a sort, has been made over the last 50 years,. At least today most people can imagine Jill Biden being an MD.  It was only 48 years ago that All in the Family ran its famous riddle episode about the surgeon who refused to operate on a patient because the patient was the surgeon's son, even though the surgeon was not the patient's father."
Richard Murphy,but she's not an MD -- she should make sure she qualifies herself as by saying she holds a Ed.D from U Del -- whoopppeeeee!!!!
John Capetta,"I wrote ""imagine [her] being an MD"".  I did not write that she is an MD."
Richard Murphy,"Yes, but that is the problem.  For years after I repeatedly heard her referred to as Dr. Jill Biden, I assumed she was an MD or someone -- Jill perhaps --  would have clarified that she wasn't even a Ph.D. but an Ed.D.  and there is a difference.  Maybe the Bidens hope that by giving the impression she is a doctor that that will explain how the Bidens became wealthy.   "
sarah Millinghausen,It's not anyone's fault except for your own that you assumed Dr. Jill Biden was a medical doctor. She has never claimed to be nor insinuated that she was. 
John Capetta,"Richard-The point I was making was that 50 years ago, many people in the U.S.  could not imagine a woman being a surgeon, which is why the #1-rated TV show in the country back then devoted a whole episode to that issue, and why it was such a telling episode.  It had nothing to do with the issue you are pointing to.  John"
Margaret Christian,"I believe Dr. Biden has delivered one more child than you have. I imagine many women (both those catching  the child and delivering it) would be surprised to hear that doing so was the magic qualifier.Coincidentally, a male obstetrician was the only person ever to call me ""kiddo"" as an adult. I asked the medical assistant on the next visit to write in my chart, ""Patient prefers not to be called ""Kiddo."" That's ""Dr. Kiddo"" to you, Mr. Epstein."
Shana Lyons,"While Mr. Epstien certainly has a right to his opinion, I am deeply disappointed in the WSJ for printing this sexist and classist garbage. Dr. Biden earned her (non-honorary) doctorate degree through her own hard work over the course of years of study. Why would you suggest she cast off an earned title for one that only surfaces the accomplishments of her husband? And, why would her degree be less valid because she chose to study how best to help students at the Community College level? Community colleges are a critical educational option for students who do not have the desire or ability (financial, time wise, or whatever)  to pursue a 4 year degree.  "
Patricia Koch,"I cringe at the fact that my daughter's PhD from Indiana University has been demeaned in a mainstream publication.  I witnessed the painstaking research she conducted to complete her dissertation while simultaneously packing a 10 month old infant.  She is an accomplished author, professor, and mom. And here am I, defending her right to be addressed as ""Doctor H..."" if SHE so chooses.  Grrrr..."
Dan R,"@Patricia, I have a PhD degree.  Very few in business world address PhD as ""Doctor"", unless if it is a pharmaceutical company and they are developing vaccines and drugs.  Your daughter might be rudely awakened in the business world.  Maybe she should focus more on more important factors like job security and how much she is paid, as opposed to if her bosses without a PhD call her ""Doctor"" or whatever other paper title that she prefers.   "
Paul Groh,"In academia, they  do often use the honorific."
Dan R,"@Paul Groh, as I said ""maybe she should focus on more important factors... like how much she is paid"".  In academia, they pay very poorly and this is especially true of new PhD holders."
EA yke,I work In a school district....all the PHD professionals go by doctor. This is silly.
Abram Glazer,"Shame, shame on you WSJ for giving this sexist piece reach. How very unprofessional,  backwards, and insulting to women."
Maureen Fitzgerald,How pathetic it is for the writer of the piece to take the time to try to diminish Dr. Jill Biden. He failed.  I  don't agree with his views but I don't understand why the   Wall Street Journal considered this worth publishing. Come on Wall Street Journal.  Have some class and standards. Don't publish such drivel.
Cindy Fryman,"""Irony""She has a PhD in education and his biggest association is for plagiarism,Tom F"
MICHAEL PARDEE,Melania Trump plagiarized a speech once given by Michelle Obama. 
MICHAEL PARDEE,Melania plagiarized a speech given by her predecessor as First Lady.
Jack Reich,"Extremely disappointing on two fronts.  Mr. Epstein demeans  men and women who dedicated time and talent to achieve this highest academic recognition.  Second, though Mr. Epstein is entitled to his opinion, however ignorant, WSJ continues to debase its proud tradition of conservative values.  Why have WSJ editors in recent years prostituted their once fine reputations catering to extremes?  Doubtful that had this been Melania that WSJ would have printed this misogyny.  My sister received her Doctorate because of dedication to learning and ability to transfer knowledge to others she serves.  She managed this while overcoming cancer.  Two of my sons attended the School of Communications at Northwestern.  My respect for Northwestern's creative writing program is high.  I hope Mr. Epstein does not represent a majority of its faculty.  "
Pam Pruyn,Amen. I was thinking the same thing. My daughter graduated from there. I would love to have been a fly on the wall during his interview for the position. 
Raymond Min,"After reading this article, I know even $4 monthly subscription is overvalued."
Cindy Fryman,"There's a bigger point.Look for the media to glom over everything Biden like they are the second coming. It will be the exact opposite of the Trump treatment. Every positive about the Trump's was ignored. Every breath they took was twisted into something bad.Joe's wife is fine. But, we had a spectacular First Lady in Melania - super smart - and she was ignored except when the media wished to fabricate a sinister conspiracy about the Trump marriage.The media will celebrate the Biden's to the hilt - if for no other reason than to try to keep us looking past the ultimate conclusion that they helped elect mediocrity. Tom F"
Paul Groh,"Melania was super smart? How on earth would you know??? A former softporn model with mo college degree and a penchant for birtherism...maybe she is a ""stable genius"""
Wallace Rolf,She speaks many languages and does not answer questions in huffs and grunts.
Charles Swanson,"Tom,  do you think Trump chose her for her intellect, her scintillating conversation? So she would be an intellectual match for his ""stable genius? If you think Melania is ""super smart,"" I'm guessing you're no PhD."
Donald Sullivan,"I know newspapers have to fill space, but seriously? This is embarrassing."
patricia howell,"I have always found it overbearing, to say the least, that Mrs. Biden uses Dr. before her name."
Emery Roe,"Remember, this is the same erudite Joseph Epstein who proudly quotes ""What I don't know isn't knowledge"" and wraps himself in the brotherhood of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought."
Marina de Gramont,"Since you took the time to edit this piece and correct the misidentification of Seth Meyers, perhaps you could do this for the complete text and replace it with an apology? I subscribe to WSJ on and off. Unless I see a formal and prominent apology for publishing this assault on accomplished women, it's going to be permanently off."
Julie Robert,"Mr. Epstein - can you please share with us the same article I'm sure you wrote about Dr. Phil? As I'm sure you're aware, he is also not an M.D.?"
JANET JOHNSON,"I taught math in IL with a BA and MS in math, and extra courses to get certified to teach. When I moved to NC in the 80s, I could not teach because they required a degree in Math Ed, not Math with certification. I looked into getting a Math Ed BA and it was about as much work to get a Ph.D. in Math Ed, so I went that route. I had never heard of an Ed.D. We could get either. The Ed.D. was much easier, but I went for the Ph.D. The courses were significantly easier than my undergrad courses. We were required to take some Stats for Ed majors course that was about 8th grade level math at best.  I protested. We were not even allowed to take real Stat classes instead. They made an exception for me because I threatened to cause trouble. Over in the Stat building, in my first graduate level math class the prof asked us all our majors. When I said Math Ed, he told me to wait after class and talk. He told me an education major could never pass a class like this. Ed.Ds and Ph.Ds are treated same."
Scott Bonnett,Sounds like good 'ole boy sour grapes. I guess WSJ really is just a polished up Fox News.
ELAINE MACHLEDER,"I like Mr. Epstein's opinion piece. It seems pretentious and misleading to call yourself  ""Dr."" especially in a non academic setting. It holds for men as well as women. It's an opinion, after all. Why do people  get worked up about it with threats and punishment if they don't agree.  "
Aritomo Shinozaki,"Opinion columns are all about choice:  Choice of what to create, choice to publish, choice of words.  Given the limited and select number of words a journal like the WSJ could choose to create and print - why does this opinion piece even exist?    To Wit:""Madame First Lady-Mrs. Biden-Jill-kiddo"" - really, what are you reflecting in this choice?  ""The prestige of honorary doctorates has declined even further"" - OK, why paste this sentence next to the name of someone with an actual doctorate? If your purpose of this whole piece was to label as sham the whole production of doctorates - well, I'm not seeing that as high value (and a false premise) - our times have many many more signficant topics - say the behavior of our current President, or say the fumbled commitment to secure more vaccine earlier this year, or say the creation of a false democracy where the word ""informed"" in ""informed electorate"" is  threatened.  Many more topics out there.  So WSJ - why choose this?"
PETER DYKE,"Many NEA (""teachers"") with political or social ambitions upgrade to PhD/Ed.D degrees with simple, mail-order, evening ""courses"". It should be noted that Dr. Jill is also a Published scholar (no kidding((pun)) ). Meanwhile, physicians often regularly are downgraded in this prestige ranking with ""health-care worker"", ""worker"", ""provider"" substituted for ""Dr."" as they transition from profession to Corp. MBA employees in the new ""health-care industry"". "
Wanetta Ayers,"Although this is an ""opinion"" column, I can't believe the Wall Street Journal would give this dreck any space. Not only is Mr. Epstein factually incorrect, his opinion hews closely to sexism and bullying. Why the editors of the Wall Street Journal would even consider this topic is beyond me. It has nothing to do with the substantive subject matters that have been this publication's domain.  Stick to newsworthy topics - whether its reportage or opinion. These kinds of personal attacks have no place in civil conversation, let alone the once venerable auspices of the Wall Street Journal. You can do better than this. Your subscribers deserve better than this. Dr. Jill Biden deserves better than this. "
Cindy Fryman,Correct.  You would think her last name is Trump.Tom F
Harvey Scott,"Yes, the Doc thing is a bit silly, but using that honorific title for graduates of most British (and Kiwi/Aussie) medical schools is likewise technically a misnomer (they are bachelor's degree), even if they have delivered a baby (criterion mentioned herein). The thing about these naming conventions is the Dr. is most commonly employed as a ""courtesy title""; meaning, it really is not up to Dr./Mrs./Ms. Jill Biden as to whether or not the title is used. That is the prerogative (and courtesy) of the person that addresses her, whether directly or in the third person. Yes, there are social norms and expectations (the author will likely choose to refer to the husband as President Biden rather than Joe).But, don't blame Dr. Biden for someone else's display of courtesy."
Joan Smith,"Is anyone else tiring of the constant extolling of ""non p-c"" commentary as an excuse for angry, resentful contempt?  This guy surely considers himself a ""warrior for truth,"" and must be a horror to live with."
Patrick Tyrrell,"Wow - such vitriol!   Such righteous anger!  So many thin-skinned, insecure, easily threatened people out there.   it's obvious the author has hit too close to home for so many.  And yet, they so easily resort to insults of which they so angrily accuse the author.  Unintentional irony at its best!"
Lori Coleman,WSJ - are you listening?  You should promptly publish a rebuttal article on this 20th century thought piece.  What were you thinking?  Did you think the millions of woman PLUS the millions of men and women who have earned the honorific of Dr as a result of their contribution to their field would be ok with this.  I haven't quite decided if I will cancel my (18 year) digital + print  subscription to the WSJ.  But it could happen.
robert whalen,Please keep us posted on your final decision -- the suspense is killing!
Dan R,"I would not be opposed to a rebuttal as long it provides space for comments, unlike the other media today which printed rebuttals but had no space for comments.   In this age of ""cancel culture"", I bet that for every cancellation there will be three that subscribe because they have finally found a place in media today that is unlike Communist China and does not censor opposing views in the comments..   "
A Nisbet,"I've never met Joseph Epstein, but I will bet that he has informed anyone who has, at great length, that he taught at Northwestern with only a BA that he earned having taken an exam at Fort Hood.  I will further bet that the details of his story, his peacetime service, the unnamed school that gave him an honorary degree, his career as a teacher, line up with many caveats and is distinctly unimpressive.Mr Epstein, Merry Christmas.  I hope you get some help with your excruciating insecurities and find some peace.WSJ, what are you thinking?"
Patrick Tyrrell,They are providing a provocative opinion.  That's what they were thinking.   Heaven forbid!
Jason Eriksen,"Despite nearly two millennia passing since it first came into  use, Mr. Ellis seems dumbfounded that  honorifics are recognized outside of  the rather narrow confines of medicine. The word ""doctor"" has a long and storied history, and is derived from the Latin doctoris, a teacher or instructor. In Middle English (c. 1150-1500) it became used for any learned man or medical practitioner. In modern American vernacular, this honorific is bestowed to distinguish the highest degree of expertise recognized in a particular field of study. The use of an honorific is bestowed by convention in a professions. Surgeons in the UK go by the honorific of Mr/Miss/Ms/Mrs. An honorific is a matter of convention, and denotes respect. Mr. Ellis should recognize that Dr. Biden was awarded her doctorate in education, and she is entitled to use this honorific, by convention, in recognition of her expertise. "
Jerrod Mason,"I'm more bothered by obsolete honorifics. To me, it's ""Mr."" Obama and (to be fair) ""Mr. Flynn."" Titles belong to the office, not the person."
alice sharp,Clearly Mr. Epstein you are not proud of your accomplishments. The need to degrade other's accomplishments is a mirror into your own soul. 
P Curr,He was saying it's not really an accomplishment at all...
Keith Brown,"Unless you personally reviewed Dr. Jill Biden's work and curriculum to see how she achieved her doctorate, I fail to see how Mr Epstein has any authority to claim doctorates are now invalid"
P Curr,"And yet he did, which led to discussion. That's the whole point of an opinion piece.  "
Lyman Carter,It's great to share an opinion.  It's not great to be pompous and mean spirited.
Gillian Grant,"Of all the stupid things to write about during these times, this takes the cake. (Dr.) Joseph Epstein, go volunteer at your local Food Bank and get in touch with reality. "
David O'Bryan,It's too bad I can't get wsj news only. The opinion pages are propaganda for the Trump Party.
Cindy Fryman,So read ANYTHING else and you can get some propaganda for Democrats and the Left.Tom F
thomas schink,"An earned doctorate entitles the recipient to be addressed as Dr., and for that matter, so does an honorary degree for those who want to use it. Dr. Jill Biden has been working as a college professor. She certainly has the right to the title and should be given the respect that is due her. My wife also has an earned doctorate and teaches at the college level, but she always played it down until she went to a professional meeting and an older male addressed her as ""Honey."" She also recognized that the people around her are very insistent on using the term Dr. for men who have degrees, so it is important for the goals of gender equity that women who have earned these degrees receive the same acknowledgement of their achievements and positions."
Maureen DiRienzo,"I have been in the same situation. I said nothing, smiled.  Then the men realized that I was the keynote speaker.   I enjoyed the looks on their faces. It's a lot more fun this way than stamping your foot and insisting on how you are to be addressed."
Patrick Tyrrell,Living well is the  best revenge!  (Oscar Wilde)
Dick LaFever,"The B.S. from the Right never takes a break it seems.  Now comes the WSJ (owned by Rupert Murdoch - Fox News Empire).  Jill Biden earned an EdD from a reputable University, unlike the defunct, discredited, and successfully sued Trump University. 
Such a pathetic, cowardly, sniveling attempt at being relevant.  Writer Joseph Epstein is a colossal putz. A minor league agitator writing for a once proud and relevant journal.  
Dr. Biden, welcome to the White House."
Gregory Smith,I'm cancelling my subscription and subscribing to The Financial Times.  This is too over the top for me. There are plenty of places to read this type of garbage if I wanted. I'm sure not paying to do so. From other sources it appears Northwestern didn't like it either. 
David Beidler,As a long time Journal subscriber I am scratching my head over this piece. What is the point?
Vincent Benintendi,I'm a long time journal subscriber and I think it's fantastic.
PATRICK Woods,Has a B.A. in absentia?   Another phony like Sidney Powell's star expert I.T. witness who turns to have been a grease monkey/tire changer in the Army after flunking out of even basic courses like Computers For Dummies.
Patrick Tyrrell,"And yet, it's OK for you to fling insults.  How ironic.  Will you now be cancelling your subscription in outrage?"
John Capetta,"Perhaps the WSJ EB could ask Dr. Henry Kissinger to step in as White House M.D. during the Biden Administration.  Since the WSJ unerringly refers to him as ""Dr."",  he must have delivered a baby or two over the last 50 years."
Shahdabul Faraz,"Was there a point to this piece, sir? She is not liable for the apparent general decline in standards of American higher education, even if I grant you that there has been such a decline. She earned her doctorate and if she wishes to be called as such, go for it. I'm a medical doc, but I just like to go by my first name. That's fine too. WSJ is an important and influential newspaper. Surely, more interesting and important discussions can be had in its opinion pages.  "

Mike OHara,Obviously dr jill's parent's knew she'd be a doctor when they named her.
David Oetting,"Well stated.  As a JD for 40 something years I have always been offended by the use of ""Dr."" by anyone other than an MD.  "
Tom Xu,Critical levels of copium detected!
Aritomo Shinozaki,"My father is both an MD and and has a doctorate.  He always  told me the Dr. = his doctorate, the MD represented his medical degree.  He prided himself on the Dr. portion as he used to say that the MD does not equal scientist - as he was both a scientist and a practicing physician, he distinguised the two achievements clearly.   My grandfather was a PhD - he is also Dr.  I have one also - I do not use Dr myself, but do not find it offensive when someone else with the conferred degree is called Dr.  My wife has a PhD - I do refer to her as Dr.    My son intends to study for a PhD in physics - I will refer to him as Dr when he earns it.  I cannot speak to your being offended - but on my regard and to those around me with PhDs we have earned our Doctorates we are Doctors in the traditional sense - one that holds a Doctorate."

Mark McCombs,"bothsidesism, brilliant."
Patrick Tyrrell,"Didn't take much, did it?"
Greg Godwin,"I have come to expect op-eds such as this from the once revered WSJ, which sadly has gone the way of the GOP (off the deep end). While I still respect the News arm, the Opinion arm has become as nasty, toxic, and vitriolic as anything you'd see on Tucker Carlson, Hannity and the other crazies on Fox. I will be canceling my subscription, not because of this op-ed but because of the sheer weight of ugly, unbalanced op-eds this paper publishes daily. I cannot support it."
Nicholas Marziani,"Someone needs to remind readers that generally accepted journalistic industry standards regarding professional titles, particularly use of ""Doctor""/""Dr."" limits the use of that title to medical, dental, and veterinary professionals. Even someone with many terminal academic degrees, ie. Ph.D., etc., are generally listed as ""Mr."" or ""Ms."", perhaps even Professor. This flap about Jill Biden is way off base, and although Mr. Epstein was indelicate in his manner of expressing himself, he was only adhering to industry standards. When my daughter was getting married in Boston years ago I couldn't get my own ""Dr."" designation in the New York Times (her choice to announce in that paper), although I also worked hard for my Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.). So let's all grow up and let go of the odium and name-calling much too apparent in commentary on Mr. Epstein's opinion piece."
David Sims,"Mr. Epstein was not just ""indelicate in his manner of expressing himself"" and he was not simply ""adhering to industry standards.""He has chosen to attack of woman with expertise, credentials, and accomplishments.  This is something he would not attack a man for, and it is also apparent from his comments about living in ""public housing"" that this is a swipe at the President Elect as well.This piece drips with misogyny, and with ridicule for another person's work basing his assessment of that work on the title of a dissertation.  Has Mr. Epstein read that dissertation?  Do you think he has?Last, if you don't like name calling, perhaps you could address the author himself, who calls Dr. Biden ""Kiddo"" (disrespectful) and ""Dr. Jill"" (belittling and overly familiar).  Maybe it's MISTER Epstein who needs to grow up, and perhaps you might reconsider some of your condescending ""parent talk"" (""So let's all grow up..."") too."
Aritomo Shinozaki,NA
Cindy Fryman,"There's a bigger point. Look  for the media to glom over everything Biden like they are the second coming.  It will be the exact opposite of the Trump treatment.  Every positive about the Trump's was ignored.  Every breath they took was twisted into something bad. Joe's wife is fine. But, we had a spectacular First Lady in Melania - super smart, super beautiful - and she was ignored except when the media wished to fabricate a sinister conspiracy about the Trump marriage.
The media will celebrate the Biden's to the hilt  - if for no other reason than to try to keep us from looking past the ultimate conclusion that they helped elect mediocrity.

Ellis Wyatt,People with little self confidence insist on titles. 
Maureen DiRienzo,"Yes, they make themselves look small and needy. "
Anne Flynn,"The biggest takeaway from this article (along with WSJ's poor decision to print it) is Epstein's revelation of himself.   Instead of setting forth eight paragraphs of disjointed content, he could have summarized his message in one sentence: ""I'm a sad, small,  bitter and jealous man.""  Creepy comes to mind, as well."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Are women viewed as such delicate helpless creatures that someone referring to them as ""kiddo"" is an outrage?  Oh, show me the swooning couch!"
David Sims,"It's disrespectful to someone you're not on familiar terms with.  Nobody's going to run to the bedroom to have a good cry.  Of course not, but the tenor of this entire piece drips with sarcasm, misogyny, and nastiness.  Does the world benefit from even more of this type of gratuitous boorishness?"
chuck harmon,"Mr, Epstein used many relevant examples to make his case, contrary to the many insults and name calling used by those attacking him. Apparently there is no acceptable PC argument that may be made against any Liberal, no matter how credible?  "
Ilya Shlyakhter,How is his discussion of honorary doctorates relevant to Jill Biden's earned one?
P Curr,"It illustrates how lax the standards for ALL doctorates have become in academia, most notably in the humanities (and even more notably in Education).  "
David Sims,Not sure how this is only an issue for liberals.  There are conservatives who also hold doctoral degrees.
Dan R,"Why such a strong reaction from the left on this?  I believe because most are deeply in college loan debt for similar graduate degrees in education, social sciences, humanities, and gender/ethnic studies, so they see an attack on an Ed.D. degree as an attack on their own education which has not quite returned the investment that they had hoped."
robert whalen,"One must be considerate of those with exalted degrees. I also say ""Thank you, Dr. Waitress"" when a barista with a PhD in Elizabethan poetry serves me my coffee."
Ilya Shlyakhter,"I've paid my college loans back in full years ago, and am deeply offended by this piece.   One has nothing to do with the other."
Dan R,"Ilya, Is your degree an Ed.D. or something similar as I mentioned above?  Or maybe in evolutionary biology? Only those with an outsized view of education  or PhD would take exception."
Ilya Shlyakhter,"My Ph.D. is in computer science.   I don't routinely use the Dr. honorific.   I take exception to the boorish/condescending tone (""kiddo"") and to dishonest argument (lumping honorary degrees with earned ones, ignoring the clearly non-medical context where there's no chance anyone will think Dr means MD)."
Marlaina Geddes,"On behalf of female leaders in business everywhere I would like to say that the Wall Street Journal is not only a disappointment but apparently a safe haven for sexist and misogynistic publication of opinion pieces. It's one thing to promote healthy conversation, it is another entirely to promote by providing a platform for misogyny and blatant sexist tropes of older Generations, which have no place in our current industries or world.That this piece has not been removed and an apology or retraction published by the editors of the Wall Street Journal prove that this is a last bastion of misogynistic journalism.

However this was a piece of pure sexist trash where Epstein, who has an un-earned honorary doctorate, belittles and demeans Dr. Biden for her EARNED PhD. He further insults her field of study even though education is an issue of national concern. I expect the editors to publish a wide variety of viewpoints. I do not expect them to publish pieces that are only about the author's misogyny."

Maureen DiRienzo,"Once again, she didn't earn a PhD.  She earned the lesser EdD.  Part time school, a term paper, and voila! a EdD.  So high school principals can be called Doctor and demand more pay.  "

And how is the extended ridicule of honorary degrees relevant to her earned one?   Sure, there are undeserved doctorates, but how is she made a poster child for these without looking at her thesis beyond its title?   And the tone, ugh...  ""Kiddo"" -- seriously?   ""Public housing"", as if she can't earn enough to get a market-rate place?   How is this piece not beneath WSJ's standards?"

By Jackie SaloDecember 13, 2020 | 12:15pm | Updated, NYPostJust think if the situation was reversed, and Melania had gotten a doctorate for, say her understanding of multiple languages, her trials and tribulations of navigating  immigration policy, whatever, etc. The Democratic Machine would be ""up in arms"". Keep in mind that the most attractive ""First Lady"" since Jackie Kennedy was never featured on the cover of our major publications. What a sham. The MSM is a joke. They and the alt liberal education system, like Northwestern are now playing biased politics. What a sham, again."
Gwyneth Hogarth,"The fact that you place so much value on Melania's looks indicates that you and the author of this drivel are both channeling the same chauvinism and misogyny of the 1950s, which may be why you're so sympathetic to him."
Sarah BIRCH,"This article is piece of garbage. Dr. Biden earned her degree as the right to be called by the honorific. Mr. Epstein, I assume you also have problems with dentists and veterinarians using the title.  I wonder if you would express these thoughts quite so opening if Dr. Biden were a man. "
J Satterfield,What an embarrassment for the WSJ.  I don't care whatsoever what J. Epstein thinks.  I am astonished that the paper would allow such garbage to be printed.  What was the purpose of this article?   Waste of time!
Nicholas Wu,This is comic and ridiculous!
Vincent Benintendi,Says a Left Wing Socialist dictator
Maureen DiRienzo,"Given that her husband plagiarized work, requiring him to drop out of an earlier campaign, and also lied about his achievements in college, maybe she feels she needs to be called Doctor to distinguish herself from her academically challenged other half.  "
Greg G,"I see that Northwestern has now CANCELED Mr. Epstein by  removing his name from their website, etc. The snowflake student newspaper states (completely backed by faculty/admin), ""Northwestern is firmly committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, and strongly disagrees with Mr. Epstein's misogynistic views"".  How rich!?  Apparently, NU only believes in 'diversity' as long as it lines up with that  on the left/liberal/democratic side of thought.  Why would I want my straight A daughter to attend NU?  Obviously an institution that does not promote critical thinking, diverse opinions, and freedom of speech."
Lynn Heider,"Joe- 

This is not hate mail. The fact you got so much pushback on your opinion piece about Dr. Biden should not surprise you or hurt your feelings. 

You made the decision to write such a piece, and to pitch it to WSJ, knowing it would get a lot of attention and perhaps shine a light on your book. 
As I read your piece, it occurred to me you are using an attack on our next First Lady as a means of apologizing for your own educational background and making excuses for your career accomplishments. 

I, too, have only a BA degree. I'm proud of it, but readily acknowledge that I didn't work as hard as Dr. Biden to further my education. I don't begrudge her for her decision to use the Dr. title. It occurs to me that it likely inspires a lot of people who don't come from privilege and who may think they can't accomplish their dreams. 

This particular First Lady will be neither a ""kiddo"" nor a ""Madame"" as you spelled the word, but rather a compassionate and accomplished leader. How refreshing! 
"
robert whalen,"If every subscriber actually carried-through on his threat to cancel his subscription to the WSJ over some minor offense then the paper would have folded by its third issue. This is catnip for its editors! A mildly cheeky and amusing essay has drawn attention from all over the world -- the publisher must be doing cartwheels down Park Avenue!What a pompous bunch the woke are! Thousands of humorless comments, most of them reeking of self-importance and posed indignation. All in all, they remind one of those bobble-heads one used to see in the rear windows of cars.As for ""Kiddo,"" what have the Woke NOT called President Trump? And, from time to time, among all the disgusting vitriol directed at the president, there comes  a clever zinger that makes one laugh.Politics ain't beanbag!

Among other disclaimers there is no President Elect, the 2020 election is not certified, the Electoral College has not voted and the WSJ has gone to bed with mass media, promiscuous in its truist sense of the word. My subscription ends at midnight December 31, 2020 due to presumptuous commentary like this and current WSJ headlines like ""Trump Supporters Protest Biden Win."" Trump supporters are protesting a fraudulent election stealing a Trump win.  "
Rebecca Adkins,"I think that is a wise move. If it is an echo chamber you seek, you'll be much more comfortable with news sources like The Federalist, The American Conservative, and The Washington Times.  "
Bryan Dorsey,"Petty, sour grapes by the losers."
Skyler Limber,"I'm disappointed that the WSJ editorial staff believed this petty misogynist drivel was worth publishing. I respect Dr. Jill Biden for using the title she earned to bring dignity to the important job of teaching in a community college. Sadly, both the jobs held by a lecturer with a B.A. at a top university and Ed.D. teacher at a community college are derided by the academy and paid at poverty level wages, often without health care benefits. While Mr. Epstein only seems to spew bitterness, Dr Biden brings  pride and dedication to the valuable work she does."
C Cotter,"This is absolutely the worst thing that I've read all year.  WSJ, you've obviously been effected by the idiot that's in the White House and his Education Secretary.  Shame on you!!!"
Jack Lichtenstein,Remarkable the number of minds in this forum that are incapable of seeing anything outside the prism of identity politics or dealing with an opposing point of view.  Cancel your subscription because the WSJ prints an opinion piece that you find disagreeable?  Why read it at all?  Why not just subscribe to the NY Times and the Washington Post and have all your comforting opinions reinforced?  The response here seems to actually demonstrate the vacuity of much of our modern American educational system.    
Amy A,"I am answering your question.  I've been reading the New York Times regularly since 1975 and WaPo for about twenty years.  After discussion with a conservative nephew about the Journal, he challenged me to read it daily.  I told him I would do so for one year.  My year is almost up and I will not be renewing.  First, let me say that the journalism in the Times is vastly different than it was half a century ago, and for the most part, not for the better.  But some of the opinions I've read this year in the Journal have been absolutely awful, and this is a good example.  Apart from the opinion, the writing is terrible.  Add a generous dose of sexism, and it is not worth the read.  Bye, Felicia."
Jack Lichtenstein,"Hello, Amy:  With all respect, the idea is to read more and not less.  The Washington Post nearly makes me sick with its infusion of progressive politics into everything.  Their food critic once even produced a column criticizing Trump's use of ketchup on steak (yes, a culinary sin but not worthy of a major newspaper).  Yet I continue to read the Post because I need to know what other people are thinking, both to understand them and sharpen my arguments. JL  "

Naomi Ben-Shahar,"Are you kidding? WSJ editors, shame on you for ever considering this a publishable-worthy piece. Dr. Jill Biden, and countless other accomplished women, do not tolerate being addressed in such patronizing, uninformed manner. Ridiculous!"
Kathryn Grammer,"Quit the identity/gender politics. Dr. Jill's Ed.D and her insistence that she be addressed as a doctor is laughable and cringe-worthy. I had a male friend who insisted he be called Dr. with only a Ph.D. in botany. At least he was a scientist working on ways to eradicate the citrus canker. Still he went around correcting everyone he encountered in social situations. What an eye-roller. It reminded me of the Seinfeld episode in which Elaine's boyfriend insisted he be called The Maestro, even though he conducted only a Salvation Army-level band.Everyone knows the easiest graduate degree in the academic world is in education. Such degrees don't even teach subject matters that will improve the minds of today's school-age children. Education degrees teach the rules and regulations that must be abided by in order to be certified. Dr. Jill will be a real boon to the teachers unions. First up: Eradicate the religious and charter schools. "
Keith Brown,I suppose you feel the same way about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?
Steven M. Kennedy,"What an pathetically written piece. The author spending most of the ""article"" complaining about the bestowing of honorary doctorates on public members, while knowing full well this is not even the type of degree that Dr. Biden has.  Beyond the incredibly condescending language here, often used to diminish women in professional fields, to discredit her work and accomplishment is pathetic.

Kathryn Grammer,"Did you read the article? He was a professor at Northwestern, a private Illinois institution. How could he have taught at the college level without at least a college degree?"
Bob Sanderson,Did you read the article. There is no mention he was a PROFESSOR. He was a lecturer which has a very different meaning at a University. Did you attend college? If you did you would know.
Peter Litman,"The author expresses some throughly retrograde views and I am surprised they were published. I've worked in the cable TV business for a long time and everyone knows that Dr. John Malone's Ph.D. is in operations research. If you've earned a doctorate, you have the right to the honorific. Comparing an earned doctorate with an honorary doctorate is a great example of a false equivalence."

Jennifer Reece,"It sounds like Mr. Epstein has personal issues to address, having nothing to do with Dr. Biden or her hard work and credentials.  Kiddo? I am shocked that the WSJ would publish such a sad rant. "
Lynn Bootes,"As a 68 year old female MD (now retired), I applaud Jill Biden's use of her title as a Doctor of Education. So many obstacles have existed over the decades for women in academia!!! I chickened out for even attempting an academic career because of them and went the ""easier"" route of MD. The condescending language in this editorial is disgusting. I am sure Dr. Biden will find her way as First Lady, and if men like the author of this Op Ed piece think that is a problem, then I suggest they live with their own discomfort. It is about them, not about the use of an academic title for a female PhD. "
YAEL Gozin,Could not agree more. 
Bryan Dorsey,I am guessing the author's beef is that she didn't serve as an anchor to bring her family into this country through chain migration?What a deplorable piece to publish. Shame on the WSJ.
Kathryn Grammer,Is it condescending because Dr. Jill is female.? I find it condescending that you need to defend her as though she were a damsel in distress.  Her gender has nothing to do with the article. It's the lens through which you seem to view anyone who happens to be male criticizing anyone who happens to be female. That is Humbug.If you try really hard maybe you can get past the identity politics infecting this nation and dividing Americans into tribes.
Eve B. Rose,"My parents, BOTH university professors, who received their PhDs in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, were usually called Doctor.  It is a widespread practice (though not universal, of course) in the U.S. AND around the world.  So the writer of this editorial -- and many commenters -- are ill informed.  The biggest problem, however, is the sheer opportunism.  Most of this piece discusses university teaching without a doctorate and honorary degrees. It also criticizes the process of getting a PhD.  Let's hear more about those subjects!  What's the point of that first paragraph?  And the last?  An ad hominem attack in the form of a framing device?  Opportunistic at best, lazy at worst -- and it should be below the WSJ's editorial standards."

BETH A BROOKS,"Mr. Epstein seems to assume that those awarded honorary doctorates use the title Dr.   By convention, recipients of honorary doctorates do not use the title ""Dr"" in general correspondence, although in formal correspondence from the university issuing the honorary degree it is normal to address the recipient by the title. However, this social convention is not always scrupulously observed."
Casey Harmon,"Mr. Epstien:  Jill Biden's PhD was earned through a course of study that was non-medical in its focus.  But it was earned.  Your comparison of her to entertainer-recipients of honorary doctorates is as unfair as it is for me to compare you to the hind end of a mule.  You've wasted your own time and ours, and exposed your own pettiness.  "
Maureen DiRienzo,"She doesn't have a PhD.  She has a EdD.  The EdD at U Delaware is a lesser degree than the PhD in education.  The EdD is part time and requires a term paper. The PhD is 4-5 yrs full time and a research project.  The EdD is intended for people going into admin, like a high school principal.  The PhD is intended for people pursuing research and academia. Mr Epstein has a BA and a long record of scholarship.  I would weigh his achievements over hers any day, even with her lofty EdD."
BETH A BROOKS,"An EdD (that is a ""clinical"" or ""professional"" doctorate [also known as a terminal degree]) is not a lesser degree. Comparing an EdD to a PhD is like comparing apples and oranges. You might think of it this way.  PhDs are generating new knowledge through scientific research methods, whereas clinical or professional doctorates are putting the new knowledge to work (so to speak), implementing the research findings in practice to learn what works in the real world.  I've significantly simplified things here in order to clarify and explain."
Bryan Dorsey,"Mr Epstein has a BA and a long record of scholarship.  I would weigh his achievements over hers any day, even with her lofty EdD--------Of course you would. It is especially for people like you that these next 4 years will be wonderful. Your President Biden and your Vice President Harris will be a marked improvement."
Dale Allen,she is still a lightweight 
Margie Shilling,A lightweight? Compared to who-Melania?
Kathryn Grammer,"Yes. At least Melania speaks five languages and is a qualified interpreter. Also, Melania has class."
Keith Brown,Class? She sure had class cursing out christmas and marrying perhaps the crudest president in decades
Dale Allen,she is still a poser
Joel Schlessinger,Poor Joseph Epstein ! Many people  must have stepped on his tail awfully hard to incite such ugliness! 
Alexander Agoulnik,what a sexist piece of ...
John McGarry,Northwestern University removed Epstein from its website because of this article.  The same Northwestern that has domestic terrorist and Weather Underground member Bernadine Dohrn (who was on FBI most wanted list and wife of terrorist Bill Ayers) on its law faculty.  Can't make this stuff up. Or am I being misogynistic?
Maureen DiRienzo,Of course it did!  Must bow to political correctness.  No opposing viewpoints allowed!  
Leslie Calman,"I was a  professor for 20 years at a college where faculty with doctorates were called ""professor.""  There are other institutions at which the norm is to call faculty with a doctorate ""Dr.""  So far as I know, there are none at which faculty are called ""Kiddo."" What in the world were the editors of WSJ thinking to publish this garbage?"
Bryan Dorsey,The garbage was a direct appeal to Trump's base. It is all they know.
Kathryn Grammer,It's one thing to address colleagues by their academic titles in professional settings; it's another to use it in social settings and be corrected every time you omit it. 
Keith Brown,Is the First Lady not near always in a professional setting? 
Paul Charlton,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child."" Use of an unattributed quote upon which you seem to have based your entire thesis. That alone should have qualified the article and the writer for a fail grade.The WSJ should be embarrassed for publishing such sub-standard drivel."
chuck harmon,"Paul, one doesn't have to be known to be wise. Truth and wisdom exist regardless of your understanding of them. I found his quote ""wise"";but, not your illogical attack of it. "
Paul Charlton,"""A wise man once said"" sounds to my ears like a  fancy way of saying  ""Here's some stuff I just made up. which I'd like to dress up as wisdom for those of you who aren't smart enough to tell the difference"". If you don't understand the logic, that's your problem. I just wouldn't publicize it that's all, but there again, this is America where stupidity seems to be a badge of honor for some."
Keith Brown,Do you feel that neurosurgeons such as the esteemed Ben Carson should not be a doctor because he has not delivered a child?
Christopher Wenaas,"It is embarrassing that a news organization with the integrity of the WSJ would print this, even in the opinion section.  Forget the damage this does to women in business and the political nature of this piece, it's just poor form in today's world.  It legitimizes the degradation of the accomplished, and to what end?  It draws no constructive conclusion or purposeful outcome.  It is simply the rantings of a tired old man who fears the world is passing him by.  And it is...."
Kevin Smith,"""news organization with the integrity of the WSJ""Sorry, WSJ is not a news organization. It is a shameless discredited Trump campaign mouthpiece, which is fighting with Newsmax and Brietbart for readers. ANd it does not have integrity."
Dan R,"@Kevin Smith, Breitbart is not spelled ""Brietbart"".  Maybe they only teach political correctness and not proper spelling in graduate programs you attended?"
Bryan Dorsey,"Dear Dan R, please continue to police the spelling on these comments and especially those of the Trump apologists who seem to have no clue as to how to spell the name of the Vice President elect. My guess is Trump University graduates..."
Robert Reagan,I suppose Mr. Wenaas believes censorship is preferable.
Theresa Nolan,"Agreed, wholeheartedly.  I posted the article on LinkedIn with that very message.  I opted to not include that I plan to cancel my 16-year subscription.  "
Gary C,"OMG,   this attitude still exist today?"
Bryan Dorsey,"Taken from the attack playbook of loserTrump. Attack women whenever you can, even better if you can attack their looks."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Back in my corporate days I had the honor of meeting a member of our Board of Directors who was a MD and Nobel recipient.  When introduced he said, just call him by his first name.    People who are confident in their accomplishments don't need others reminding them.I think all the fuss about Jill Biden is her insistence that people address her as Doctor.  Not whether she earned it or not, or whether she has the right to be addressed that way.  She just makes herself look a little small and needy.  "
Theresa Nolan,"Yikes.  I'm sorry that your didn't make it beyond 'secretary school'.  But if 'your corporate days' were actually more recent, then I'm at a complete loss for a response.  "
Maureen DiRienzo,"Theresa, unlike Jill Biden, I have a real scientific PhD earned 35 yrs ago, and unlike Jill Biden, I don't require people to address me as Doctor.Talk about sexist comments, Theresa.  Check your privilege, dear "
Daphna Raz,"I can tell we are on different ends of the political spectrum, Dr. DiRienzo, but it is quite telling that most of the folks responding to you assume you do not have a Ph.D. Clearly, underestimating women is not just a right wing problem..."
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Maureen - I have checked out your LinkedIn page, and your professional career - including a Ph.D. in a science field - is  impressive.  What is more impressive to me, though, is that you do not feel the need to use your ""Dr."" title in your posts - as so many commenters here have as if to lord their degrees over others.  Would that they and Mrs. Biden  had your professional modesty.  "
Maureen DiRienzo,"Donna, in my professional career in industry, I worked with mostly other PhDs.  No one called each other Doctor.  Our egos were pretty intact.  "
Rebecca Adkins,"However, had you been in academia, you would have been most certainly addressed as ""Doctor"" as that is the norm of academia. Stop putting down those who use their titles... it lessons you. Just because you don't use yours, doesn't mean others shouldn't use theirs. It is much less about ego and more about the norms of the setting. I work at a major university and all of the Faculty with PhDs, EdDs, DNPs, and other terminal degree doctorates are referred to as ""Doctors"". It isn't ego; it is simply a matter of respect. "
Evan Shumeyko,Of course there was a correction...
Susan J Johnson,"By Don JohnsonTo show how cheap Ph.D.s are, I have six nephews. Three have Ph.D.s.  All are consultants. Two are married to Ph.D.s who are tenured liberal arts academics. None strike me as brilliant or particularly wise. They're all liberals, politically correct and part of the herd. Very nice folks.We're as proud of them as we are proud of our nieces and nephews who have masters degrees and less. And they're all doing well. When we see our physicians, we call them by their first names unless we feel there is a reason to stroke their egos and be politically, which, amazingly, is relatively seldom. If all of our  physicians don't demand to be called ""Dr."" why should Ph.D.s?The NYTimes.com protestors against this article can't argue with this tongue -in-cheek piece. So they attack the author as being politically incorrect and for crossing the race-baiting and gender-baiting herds.  They're all about identity politics. Typical lefties.Quite amusing."
adam norris,"And your reply is typical of middle aged white men who are, in fact, the authors of today's societal apocalypse.  White men have been in charge of shaping societies and cultures for thousands of years, and you did it at the expense of every human being who wasn't a white male.  Good for you.  But now, it's no longer your turn.  You're the minority.  Get used to it."
Vincent Benintendi,"Great article, Mr Epstein.  Anything that torments the left is just fine with me."
Charles Flynn,"The BBC article about the backlash to this WSJ opinion piece was posted five hours ago. Its title: Jill Biden: Backlash after WSJ op-ed calls future first lady 'kiddo' . It concludes with:The BBC's own style guide uses the title Dr to refer to doctors of medicine, scientific doctors and church ministers who hold doctorates, when relevant.
 "
Sam Mwangi,"This opinion piece says more about the writer than about Jill Biden. With only a Bachelors degree, he spent 30 years adjunct teaching at a university surrounded by PhDs. That can do real damage to your ego! And he was too lazy and unmotivated to earn graduate degrees during that time! People like that resort to denigrating those who have doctorates. They are envious and jealous that they have something they could not earn.The Editorial section of the WSJ needs to be overhauled to save the paper from losing more subscribers. As it exists now, it's loaded with sexist and bigoted men who have turned its editorial section into the new StormFront. I completely agree with the letter that was issued by the WSJ newsroom this summer calling on the WSJ editors to completely separate the news artices from the opinion pieces because the later were diluting the journalistic integrity of the WSJ. Nothing confirms that more than the editorial section's decision to print this opinion piece!"
Vincent Benintendi,Go read the NYT IF ALL YOU WANT IS LEFT LEABNING pc
Greg Godwin,"Yes, also go to the NYT for the best in commenting. So many of the WSJ commenters can barely write."
Walter Baranger,"As a university professor with no doctorate or masters degree, I have never begrudged my colleagues the Dr. title.The earned it and if they want to use it, it's fine with me. Stripping the honorific brings up a question: Where would we stop? Should a microbiologist working on a cure for cancer drop the Doc? What about a physicist researching a device to treat Alzheimer's? Or maybe a psychologist treating PTSD at a V.A. hospital? Or a speech therapist in a children's hospital?Apparently the Drop the Doc movement should encompass anyone with a doctorate in a field for which low pay, long hours and a lack of respect are expected to be tolerated by those indentured into the profession. Such as education."
ROBERT TIDMORE,"If I recall it Click and Clack the Tappet Brothers had a real issues with ""Dr's"" who couldn't draw blood."
Mike Marks,What a petty essay.  And I sense a bit of private school snobbery looking down upon us unwashed masses from State Universities. 
Arthur Kratkiewicz,I always thought M.D. stood for Me Dunno!!
Anna Wood,"I am truly appalled by these men who feel the need to knock down a strong and educated woman. This is not the only article I have seen put out by men here at the WSJ on the subject. You should feel a shamed of yourself for writing such an article!  When you speak about a woman in this manner, it makes look weak and scared! It saddens me that some men still feel the need to cut down woman to make themselves feel better about their own  insecurities. Thank god there are men out there that can embrace it and feel better being with a strong partner instead of trying to put her in her place. "
Sally Henry,"Kiddo? Really? The person who needs more education is the author of this sexist piece.Dr. Jill Biden is without doubt the most inspirational first lady we've had--like so many working women she will continue her career despite the obvious huge demands her husband's career and her family put on her.  It's about time that we're talking about a first lady's education instead of her wardrobe or pearls.The piece is also take-your-breath-away classist--figuring out how to keep students in community colleges is less important than learning Greek or Latin?Gimme a break, kiddo. "
John Taylor,This man's ignorance and arrogance is astounding. I'm a little surprised that the WSJ chose to publish this rant. People who academic doctorates work extremely hard on them. It should also be noted the Bill Cosby's doctorate is NOT an honorary doctorate. He received his EdD from the University of Massachusetts. 
Lisa-Helene Lawson,"""Kiddo "" ?!    Well Editorial Board Kiddos !  This  oped along with no chastising of  President Trump's reprehensible behavior since the election, and the continuing  apologist stance for retired General Flynn's well documented disturbing actions; including;  post pardon , the sharing of  a message calling on the President to invoke martial law  and hold a new election ...well it's all too irresponsible.  I won't be renewing my subscription at the end of the month. There is a serious and respectable salmon -pink color paper that just so happens to be running a discount since yesterday."
Kristin Rodriguez,"And the WSJ made room for this stone-aged thought piece for what reason?  The writer should just come out and say he's jealous and would rather we all still lived in 1850 where women and all minorities stepped aside for white men who deserve respect.   By the way, I know a lot of women who have ""delivered  a child"" or even more than one.  According to Mr. Epstein, they should all be called Dr.   Most of us call them ""Mom."""
Kevin Smith,#Beatrix Kiddo
Thomas Harvey,"It is a rare thing that one can so perfectly project - all in a single piece - one's own incredible ignorance, misogyny, deep sense of intellectual insecurity, and desperate need for attention. Bravo Mr. Epstein. And thanks for the reminder and the subscription savings - you'd think after 38 years of reading I would have learned.  The WSJ editorial pages consistently diminishes the papers great reporting  with its own unique blend of smug arrogance, boorishness, Rip Van Winkle economics, and predictability. "
adam norris,This opinion article is nothing more than a political hit piece.  Period.  I'm embarrassed for the WSJ leadership that allowed it to be published.  Shame on all of you.
Sacha Taylor-Kregel,"Opini'on piece indeed. Joseph, Joe, Kiddo...a little advice.   Your title is your choice,  her title is hers.  She earned the right to it just like everyone else who did the work. Fix your tone,  you sound demeaning and misogynistic."
Roberto Buratta,"Applause, applause!  Dr. Jill.  Dr. Phil.  All pretentious.  Dr.Anthony Fauci is happy to be addressed as Anthony or Tony  Take a cue from the real deal! "
Bryan Dorsey,Emblematic of the pure hate and misogyny of the Trump apologists. He taught you well. 
Robin Whitney,"Dear Mr. Epstein,  Please step aside and get out of the way.  Your piece does nothing to advance us as a nation and a culture, or as individual businesspeople.Dear Wall Street Journal,  Please stop publishing such drivel.  ""Madame First Lady-Mrs. Biden-Jill-kiddo"" -- really? Signed,Still a subscriber for now,  but  starting to wonder."
Vincent Benintendi,The left wing dictators ae really going on all on this one. What a shame.
Charles Shelley,"I worked for several decades at two different universities - note not community colleges. The holders of the Ph.D were referred to as Professor Jones, not Dr. Jones.  This is common practice and referring to them as Dr was reserved for humor situations and a.hole faculty. In a few cases, such as the President of the university, the Dr title would be used.  I won't get into the difference between the rigor of the Ed.D vs Ph.D.  (Prof. Shelley's wife...not Dr. Shelley...I would correct anyone who made that error)"
Rebecca Adkins,"I have taught for 10 years at a major university and all of our holders of terminal degrees are referred to as Doctors. I have also attended 4 different schools along the way and the same was true so I'm not sure where you worked. My schools are The University of Memphis, The University of Tennessee, Rhodes College in Memphis, and Southwest Community College. I am Professor Adkins as I only have a MSN; however, I am currently working on my PhD. Once I graduate, I won't correct folks if they call me ""Professor"", it is not a huge deal to me; however, I will be listed as Dr. Adkins everywhere as that is the norm of my university. "
William Halper,"Lacking substantive grounds for disagreement, the author chooses a meaningless personal attack.  It's unfortunate, but Dr. Biden is going to have to get used to this type of pettiness.  I hope that in the future the WSJ exercises editorial discretion and not provide a forum for this meaningless drivel.  I have been a subscriber since 1971 - with a few lapses here and there - and this is far below the quality that I expect.  "
Anna Wood,I totally agree and am appalled by this behavior. I have considered dropping my subscription over this because it has come from more than one writer. 
Graciela Meier,Mrs. Biden' character has already been publicly described by her ex husband. He claims they were still married when she started cheating him with who is now her husband. None of them have denied this allegation.
Bryan Dorsey,Mrs. Biden' character has already been publicly described by her ex husband----------Has Ex-President Trump's character been publicly described by his ex-wives? I think so. 
Rebecca Adkins,"Not every allegation even deserves a response. Plus, Joe and Jill have been very clear about when and how they met which does refute the ex husbands' allegation. I wonder why you are so interested in this? Where you nearly as interested in the COW's (current occupant of WhiteHouse) sordid affair with a porn star while Melania was pregnant? How about you stop peeping through the kitchen curtains Gladys and worry about your own plank in your eye?"
Bryan Dorsey,"Well said William H.This is the worst they can come up with for someone who appears to be a genuinely nice, intelligent, driven and successful woman. I imagine the author's tune would change had Dr. Jill said ""fchristmas"", as our present FL did. "
Mark Sellke,"Here's a fun quote, from a 2009 L.A. Times article with the title ""Hi, I'm Jill. Jill Biden. But please, call me Dr. Biden"". I'd put in the link to the article, but I think links get flagged by the WSJ for review.QUOTE:Joe Biden, on the campaign trail, explained that his wife's desire for the highest degree was in response to what she perceived as her second-class status on their mail.

""She said, 'I was so sick of the mail coming to Sen. and Mrs. Biden. I wanted to get mail addressed to Dr. and Sen. Biden.' That's the real reason she got her doctorate,"" he said."
Tina Seymour,What matters is that Dr. Biden  has the credentials and prefers the title.  You know what doesn't matter? Your opinion on this.  
Dan R,"Tina, should we  censor anyone who disagrees with you just as in Communist China?"
Brenda Ransley,That's a big leap Dan R.
John Mathews,No one is stopping him from self publication. That would be censorship.  The issue with many here is the WSJ editorial board's decision to publish it.
Robert Reagan,"In the United States the word ""doctor"" has become synonymous with ""physician."" It also has become a verb,  meaning to treat, heal, or repair in many contexts.  Therefore, it can cause  confusion when used be an an individual who may have a doctorate degree, but is not a physician.  Almost without exception, if one is introduced in a non-academic  social situation as ""doctor"" the assumption is that she is a physician.  My wife and I both have non-medical doctoral degrees, but would never use, and actively discourage, the title being applied to ourselves. Two further observations:  (1) In Great Britain, surgeons are addressed as ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" clinical physicians are ""Dr.""  (2) Regarding Mr. Epstein's criticism of applying  the  title to Jill Biden as misogyny  is ridiculous and  at best a comic example of hypersensitivity rampant in contemporary culture."
Mac Moore,Exactly.
Dan R,"Robert, you are absolutely right.  Yet, to say that at a university or other major media today might get you fired.  We need to stand up very strongly against the censorship forces behind the cancel culture of today.  "
JEANNE RODGERS,"Amen.  As I read through comments earlier, I was amazed at the number of people who thought this was misogyny. It is a sign of the times, that every social or cultural criticism is a result of PC and indicates innate ignorance and maliciousness.  As far back as the 80s when I got an education degree, most of my instructors wanted to be addressed by their first names.  I wouldn't be surprised if I took a class now, they would want to be addressed as, ""Hey, Dude""."
Rebecca Adkins,"If you didn't catch the misogyny in ""kiddo"", I can't possibly explain it to you. "
Kathryn Eagye,"Among all the other problems with this op-ed, I do wonder how the author got up in the morning in a country where we now have a 9/11 a day in deaths, increasing political violence, record unemployment, and other pressing issues and thought to himself: ""You know what's a problem? Jill Biden's honorific. I'll get right on that."""
JEANNE RODGERS,"Well, your thinking is somewhat what my first reaction was, but I thought it wold be too rude to write, THIS is what you deem important enough to cause you to cancel your subscription.  Group think is the mode nowadays.  Thanks for saying what many probably think."
Bryan Dorsey,Group think is the mode nowadays.--------Only in the Trumpcult.
Sarah Hathaway,"What an unimportant article and a total waste of space.  Also, as usual, we see the right wing demeaning people with degrees.  So inspiring!"
John McGarry,Left wing playbook: anything critical of someone who happens to be female is misogyny.  Anything critical of someone who happens to be black? Play the race card.  Immunize their fellow travelers from criticism.  Silence dissent.
Andrew Read,"Shame on you , WSJ, for publishing this misogynistic drivel.  Shame. "
Lena Levario,"Is the following true WSJ?  In September 1970, Harper's Magazine published an article by Epstein called ""Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity"" that used the N-word to describe being gay and was criticized for its perceived homophobia. Epstein wrote that he considered homosexuality ""a curse, in a literal sense"" and that his sons could do nothing to make him sadder than ""if any of them were to become homosexual."""
Mac Moore,What does that have to do with the article?  
Steven Aks,"As an ER doctor I stand with Dr. Jill Biden as a fellow doctor. Perhaps if we took education as seriously as a tool for American greatness we wouldn't have so many people who don't understand basic facts and public health principles.  I admire an educator at a community college. Real people who know about hard work come through community colleges. Mr. Epstein has spent his career in paneled rooms at an elite institution. Your misogyny and condescension wreaks.To Editorial Board: Shame on the WSJ for publishing this drivel. Your reporting is world class, but I will let my subscription lapse for airing this. ""Kiddo""? Really?  If you had any insight, you would have taken it down yesterday. "
W B TOWNSEND,"Yes! And as a teacher (retired) I know that research into improving effectiveness of community colleges is very important. (Written by Mrs. Townsend, B.A., M.Div., M.Ed. - but, alas, no Ph.D. And before you start, that was a joke.)"
John McGarry,"As we already knew but these comments make obvious, leftists can dish it out, but they sure can't take it."
Anna Wood,"Explain what it is exactly of what we are ""dishing out"" but can't take? Examples of relevance are expected. "
Andrew Clark,The trolls are out in full force on this one.  They even made WSJ on Instagram take down the post.  Must've hit a nerve.  Also sad WSJ capitulated.  The left remains fascist in nature regarding opposition. 
Kate Cannon,"Who is ""we""? Did you write this commentary with the author? Is there some sort of group or organization that demands women not use the title Dr. if they have earned an Ed.D,?  Is that the ""we"" you are referring to? The general public expressed disgust for an offensive position. That's what good people do and have done in this country. In fact, if more people had done that in 1930s Germany, we would not have had fascism. "
Andrew Clark,"Where in my comment did I use the word ""we""?"
William Weeks,It is disappointing that the Wall Street Journal would publish an opinion article from Mr. Epstein. 
Tanya Sanchez,"I just resubscribed to the WSJ to be greeted with this opinion piece. I won't be renewing.Mr. Epstein not only denigrates Dr. Jill Biden's accomplishments,  but he insults all of us who pursued higher education.  It is damned if you do, damned if you don't in the minds of men like Epstein.  "
Dan R,You intolerant of opposing views.  Maybe you learned this at a university?
Bryan Dorsey,You intolerant of opposing views.  Maybe you learned this at a university?---------The only university I can think of that offered a PhD in this is Trump University.
Mac Moore,"Yes, diversity of thought can be so frustrating.  Try LAT, NYT or Time magazine where diversity of thought is strictly prohibited.  Much more comforting to such sensibilities."
Tom Landgraf,Unequivocal evidence that all it takes is a thousand monkeys with thousand typewriters to bang out a Commentary good enough to for the the WSJ.PS: Epstein's piece isn't worth a half dozen bananas from Trader Joe's.
Susan Batastini,"This is the most egregious and frank piece of male chauvinism I've read in a while. MR Epstein. This just shows that you've taken up space ( shall we call you Mr Phillip Space?) and insulted an entire profession who has always been the object of pity, derision, and complete disregard for the work we do. We've let your insults wash off our backs because we know what a difference we make and we know how ignorant you are. An EdD is a practitioners degree.  A frontline practitioner. A PhD is a scholar who wishes to stay in academia and do research and publish for the common good. Dr Jill Biden like many of us knew her talents and gifts lay with the day to day interaction with real people. Thus her choice of acquiring the EdD   The fact that she has also chosen to teach at the community college level, where she has found her own place in the world , one which is not prestigious because she is helping those who didn't choose or couldn't choose the university route. Shame on you "
Mort Snerdly,"An opinion essay criticizing Jill Biden for using the honorific ""Dr."" has reportedly resulted in its author having his profile removed from the website of Northwestern University... Something the Chinese Com. party would do."
MICHAEL RUPP,"No, it's something a distinguished university would do when it has been shamed by the disgraceful actions of a faculty member."
Mort Snerdly,Disgraceful actions? It was an opinion. And you advocate deleting people because of their opinion?
chuck harmon,"Agreed, academic inflation.   But I guess it's not PC to disclose?  My thanks to you, Mr. Epstein, for doing so and taking the many insults.  Truth is often an unpleasant experience, like in the story of The Emperor's New Clothes.  Many of our credentialed leaders and their sycophants are truly naked, an ugly sight!"
David Corban,"The writer has not been a lecturer at Northwestern since 2003.  The University punked this ridiculous and petty attack.  ""Northwestern is firmly committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, and strongly disagrees with Mr. Epstein's misogynistic views.""  The WSJ should apologize for this ad hominem (ad femina?) attack, which is offensive both to the women of America and to the educators of America.  "
Dan R,Northwestern is not committed to diversity of thought.  They censor anyone with opposing views just as Communist Chinese do as pointed out by my friend Mort Snerdly.
Leo Gordon,"
The most prestigious coin of the realm in academia is being awarded the privilege of being called doctor.
An approved and vetted  upper-level thesis gives you that privilege.
There is no greater insight into the value and nature of that coin than a perusal of Michelle Obama's ""thesis"" at Princeton.
Christopher Hitchens called it a document ""so illiterate and incoherent that it was written.... in 'no known language' ""
Perhaps the apellation ""Dr."" means something different in that language."
BETH A BROOKS,"OR....the Dr. could apply to Mrs. Obama's Juris Doctor (JD) law degree.  However, most attorney's do not use the title doctor.  Some (but not all) undergraduate programs (Bachelor's degree) require a thesis. Typically a thesis is Master's degree requirement, whereas the dissertation is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) requirement.   "
nestor bermeo,Someone is jealous!! 
BETH A BROOKS,"Dear Mr. Epstein. For years MDs have tried to legislate ownership of the title ""doctor."" As you may (or may not) know,  physicians are no longer the only doctor on healthcare teams.  Nearly all healthcare professionals from physical and occupational therapists, to pharmacists, dietitians,  registered nurses and psychologists can complete clinical doctoral degrees as their terminal degree. Just like a physician's terminal clinical degree Medical Doctor (MD).  Because the AP Guidelines stipulate how Dr.  is used in the media, i.e.  Dr. is for doctor of medicine, podiatry, optometry (and a few others) the public is confused. Unable to distinguish between Dr. Jill Biden a doctor of education and Dr. Anthony Fauci a physician.  Or me, Dr. Beth A. Brooks a Registered Nurse (RN) with a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy).  Words are important-- a doctor (EdD), scientist (PhD) and physician (MD) are different experts. Who deserve our respect and proper acknowledgement for their achievement. "
Robert Reagan,"As Ms. Brooks points out, the use of the title by other than physicians is confusing.  In a hospital or other medical situation would want the person addressed as ""doctor"" who is seeing us, is a physician, not a paraprofessional."
BETH A BROOKS,"Actually, you clearly missed my point by addressing me as Ms.  The title doctor can not be owned by one profession. The AP Guidelines are out of date with the current times.  The guidelines were written at a time (I might add) when medicine and journalism were male dominated.  "
Elsa Richardson,"Most definitely a sexist, misogynistic piece peppered with such incredulous inaccuracies and misplaced snobbery. This is not only an insult to all women who have worked hard to earn their degrees for higher education, but also to all human beings who have persevered to such an achievement."
Annette Isaacson,"What a sloppy mysoginistic hit job.  As an educated professional woman, I won't stand for this.  Will cancel my subscription first thing tomorrow.  The WSJ should be ashamed it allowed such drivel to be published on its pages.  "
Dan Mobey,"This is the same ""enlightened author"" who railed against anyone daring to point out that the current first lady was once a stripper.Trump supporters, classless to the end."
Mort Snerdly,"You wrote ""Trump supporters, classless to the end. ""... Judging an entire group on the actions of a few is classy?"
Katherine Read,This is awful. So disappointed in WSJ for printing this. Cancelling my subscription. 
Mac Moore,"Read writes, ""This is awful. So disappointed in WSJ for printing this. Cancelling my subscription""Yes, diversity of thought is so repugnant, huh?  Try NYT, LAT and Time magazine, where diversity of thought is not allowed."
ROBERT HODGES,What is the point of this spiteful article? The author sounds like a disappointed academic. What was the WSJ thinking to accomplish by publishing it?
S Zell,Hunter Biden has a Juris Doctor degree since he is a lawyer.  So he is Dr. Hunter Biden.
Jim Walsh,"Maybe, he is an expert on drugs. "
S Zell,Counseling of minors as well.
Melanie Hennigan,"WSJ editors - you probably damaged your reputation more by printing this piece than almost anything you have published in a long time. WSJ Editors:: Women are wondering what your true motivation was... Democrats are wondering why attack Jill Biden this way. Basically the whole piece smacks of hyper-partisanship and sour grapes for losing. If you want to discuss the decline of American Universities - that is fair game. Do it. But going after Jill this way , when the majority of Educational doctorates (from 1950 through 2000) were for males WHO CHOSE TO CALL THEMSELVES Doctor - seems hypocritical. Just sayin'."
Jim Walsh,"It was the liberal media that promoted the use of Dr, not the WSJ. It was an attempt to make Jill look better. It is the liberal  media who didn't think being an English teacher was good enough. Go complain to them."
Clayton Knowles,"How exactly does the ""liberal media"" promote this? And who exactly is the liberal media?"
Jim Walsh,"Right, my mistake, all media is liberal and therefore the distinction unnecessary."
Susan Dawson,"Awwww sweetie, are you jealous? You know, kiddo, you could go get yourself a real big-boy doctorate of your own. I've got one; they're great! Of course, it might require you to work really hard and actually write something of merit. (Quick tip dear: this editorial wouldn't have made it past my examination committee)."
Elwood Watson,"Maybe Mr. Epstein should have taken the opportunity to earn a Ph.D. or Ed.DSounds like a case of jealousy and sexism on his part. SAD!Elwood Watson, Ph.D.  "
Jim Walsh,Why? Anybody can be a subject matter expert without a formal PhD.  Years of experience is better than a phd.
Erik Hudak,"""Of the seven deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.Of the seven deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.""-Joseph Epstein"
Laura Morris,"I had to confirm that I was indeed reading the WSJ rather than a gossip rag.  Mr. Epstein clearly has never picked up a dictionary as the word doctorate is more than just a title given to a physician.  I suggest the WSJ give him one or at least refer him to the nearest website to look up the word.  This article is full of resentment, misogyny, and ignorance.  WSJ I am disappointed in you."
Jim Walsh,Does that dictionary make a distinction between a doctorate and Medical Doctor. A doctorate in Ed is not the same as an MD.  Big difference in study programs and value to society. 
Thomas Ellis,"I have a PhD in Physics. Does that mean I'm not entitled to the ""Dr."" honorific. My aerospace employers seemed to think I deserved the title. Dr. Biden should wear that honorific proudly. She earned it."
Jim Walsh,"Wear it all you want in the appropriate environment. BTW, my employer requires certain education and professional requirements, but they confirm it at the time of hire and it's never mentioned again. Why? Because we all have it and it's not a big deal. "
Carlos Batista,"Extremely disappointed in the WSJ for publishing, and by extension, promoting such misogynistic drivel. Seriously considering canceling my subscription. Do better WSJ. "
Richard Lozano,"I'm right there, as well. Bad ideas are everywhere, but the WSJ should not lower itself like this. "
chet brewer,The WSJ is trying to get back on the trumpys good side since they are leaving in droves to infotainment sites
Ed Crouse,WSJ how could you allow this be published.  After 4 years of unbelievable sexism and racism in the Trump White House and gearing up for Biden you are picking on Dr Jill Biden's title?  A common practice for professors with PhD's or Ed.D's to be titled nonetheless!  Why not pick up the torch and keep the sexism rolling as I doubt this would be an issue if it were a 'first husband' in the White House.
Elwood Watson,Agreed
Patrick Chisholm,"""Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces."" Luke 11:14There's a Catholic prayer called the Litany of Humility. Excerpts: ""From the desire of being esteemed, deliver me Jesus.
 
From the desire of being extolled, deliver me Jesus.
From the desire of being honored, deliver me Jesus.""Though Jill Biden apparently is a Catholic, it's highly doubtful she's ever heard of the prayer. Most lukewarm Catholics are not familiar with it. Clarence Thomas, on the other hand, says he prays it regularly."
Laura Morris,If a Republican wife had a doctorate I am certain many would be shouting it for all to hear.  Scripture shall not disguise the misogyny and anger at Dr. Biden being our new First Lady.
Patrick Chisholm,I can't speak for anyone else but I wouldn't be shouting that. It is not mysogyny to critize a woman.  Women are just as intellectually tough as men. They can take criticism and adequately defend themselves if they so choose.
Kathryn Eagye,"What? Are you saying that for Jill Biden to use her earned title means she lacks humility? I presume you say the same about everyone with letters after their name, huh? Or, is it just the women?"
Patrick Chisholm,"No only God is the judge as to whether she lacks humility. And if He judges that she lacks it, then I'm sure He will have a few choice words for her when she is on the judgement seat after she leaves this world. Same for everyone else, both men and women. God is an equal-opportunity judge."
Melanie Hennigan,"And Clarence Thomas probably disparaged women regularly before he was confirmed... hmmm - not sure your point is relevant... Biden earned the title - which is given to many men as well as women... Did not see the author pick on the 100 men who preside over community colleges with the exact same degree and go by ""Doctor""...."
Patrick Chisholm,"Do you have evidence? If not, then that's calumny. On your second point, you'll need to address that with the author."
Tom Landgraf,"One of the amazing features of the bible is that for every quote, if you look hard enough, you can find the opposite.  A win-win for everyone. Pure genius."
Patrick Chisholm,"If what you say is true, then is should be easy for you to pull up such a quote. Please do so."
Keith Brown,"Interesting that Justices Thomas signs his opinions using his honorific title, and not as ""Clarence"" "
Patrick Chisholm,"Methinks in that setting, ""Clarence"" would be a tad too informal. "
Leo Gordon,"It is right and proper that our future first lady be addressed as ""doctor.""

I went to Harvard then on to MIT.

And I have the Boston Gray Line tour ticket to prove it."
Linda Oliver,"Revolting column and equally disgusting comments about the current first lady.  Those who are taking a stab at these two women, for a myriad of reasons, need to have their mouths washed out with soap. "
Richard Lozano,Unbelievable. We are crossing line after line these days. 
Robert Marlan,"As  both an MD, DDS, and Board Certified Surgical Specialist I have the utmost respect for all doctoral degrees especially in education.  It is through education that our society advances and improves the imperfections of humanity.  Clearly this published commentary represents inherent sexism and a complete lack of any understanding about degrees and education by the author.  PhDs both in education and the sciences advance humankind. It is concerning to me that this was approved by the WSJ editorial board  and given the light of day by publishing it.  Unfortunately professional success today for women often requires not only meeting but exceeding the standards required for men due to our misogynistic culture.  This article represents exactly that.  It is incomprehensible  that anyone who truly values education would write an editorial of this nature.  This article should be formally retracted by the WSJ with an apology both to the readers and Dr. Biden.

 

Robert Marlan DDS, MD"
Phoebe Wells,Thank you so much for this. Yes to everything you said.  
Melanie Hennigan,"Rock on, Robert, you speak the truth my friend. "
Vincent Benintendi,i'll never use you if I have a toothache.
Peter Kurilecz,"""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs.""this is a doctoral dissertation? puhleeze what a load of nonsense. The most useless degree coming out of our universities are the ""education"" degrees. used to be teachers held degrees in specific subjects such as maths, biology, chemistry, history et al. now if you look at our public schools I suspect that the vast majority of the teachers have an education degree. no wonder how children are so ill-prepared"
Kathryn Eagye,"Let's see. We have a raging student loan debt crisis as people pay ever more for the degrees they must have to get a decent job. But many who carry such debt did not finish their degrees. So now they have the debt, but not the degree to get the job to pay it back. Do you think student retention at community college doesn't matter?"
Susan Dawson,He's mad he didn't think of it first. 
Angela Hull,EdD's are applied degrees. Community colleges are critical to workforce development. 'Nonsense' is willfully misunderstanding both of those things. 
Tom Landgraf,"1. Judging a thesis entirely by its title, not content.I can only imagine the books in your home library are curated for their stunning covers.2. Your comment is evidence that many students fail to learn critical thinking skills.  Could it be due to the extraordinary emphasis by voters who compel schools to teach students just enough (but no more) to pass standardized tests?"
Lana Kelley,"If any of you attended college/university, you know that you addressed the professor with the PhD as ""Doctor So-and-So"" -- in recognition of their attaining the highest level of education in their field.  The only people for whom this is not true are honorary doctorates.As Jill Biden earned her doctorate, she is well within her rights to be addressed as Dr. Biden.  To brush this aside is partisan misogyny, and not worthy of the WSJ.  Shame on you."
Terrence Guay,"I've always thought the WSJ had great reporters covering the news, but the opinion and especially editorial pages were narrow-minded, simplistic, and often toxic. This piece is now my ""Exhibit A""."

ashish shete,Terrible article. So condescending.
Candy Neville,"Dear Kiddo (aka Joseph Epstein), 

May I call you Kiddo,? I want to thank you for your essay published in the Wall Street Journal asking Dr. Jill Biden to abandon the Doctor title and replace it with another term  including the misogynistic, Kiddo. You put it right out there, Kiddo. You want to draw public criticism to a woman of title. My husband was a career journalist in Oregon and I am familiar with the behind the scenes editing discussions and decisions that accompany a hot topic. I am dismayed, alarmed and really surprised that the Wall Street Journal noted this and then let it pass. If this is what passed, I'm dying to know what was edited out. 

You have disgraced both yourself and the Wall Street Journal. Both have lost much credibility and respect. I think you were hoping to come up with a snappy nick-name to use to harass and dismay. You have succeeded. Except what you thought was an arrow, was a boomerang, Kiddo. It might stick."
robert whalen,You  criticize Epstein  for sexism by citing  your husband's accomplishment -- not your own -- as your authority?
CURT BROWN,"You missed the point, and she cited her husband's knowledge of the process, not  his  ""accomplishment.""Maybe for you it's  rare that a spouse would discuss current events and relate personal knowledge to it, but for a lot of people it happens  all the time."
Susan Durbin,"I'm a 30 year subscriber and cannot believe this fine paper has embarassed itself with Mr. Epstein's op ed.  Ridiculing her for use of a legitimate academic credential and for her dissertation topic? Community colleges have long been an affordable pathway to education and mobility for lower income, diverse students.  I spent most of my career in finance and  am now part of an effort to build 2-year commuter colleges on the campuses of selective universities, and I have come to appreciate how a 2-year credential can expand access and affordability. Dr. Biden deserves praise, not ridicule, for her dedication to education access. Hey Joe - kiddo - back off. "
Angela Hull,"'Unpromising title'?! Community college is a key to economic development. Heaven forbid that their success is thus important & written for an EdD requirement, which if you knew anything at all you'd know is a sign of an applied vs research degree. I have a PhD in Ed policy from a college of ed & the difference is about 12 hours more (4 classes) in research methods bc we're trained for jobs in research rather than going back to classrooms, schools, districts or various types of post secondary institutions. Your attitude here is first misinformed not knowing basic facts, and second the condescension of a man explains to a women her worth, attempting to couch this as some sort of liberal snowflake issue when it's really your ignorance on display. Appallingly, the WSJ -- of which I'm an avid reader & use regularly to teach in my grad level public policy courses at my *gasp* state school! - has decided to use your nonsense to further what they think is a legitimate issue. "
Angela Hull,"... honest to god I'm really furious at the ignorance of this - not an essay, too poorly fact checked, not an oped, again too poorly fact checked. A whiny rant by an ill informed dude stringing together ignorance as if this were written an hour before it's due, bc he's been an A writing student all along so we'll just go ahead & give him a platform bc we glanced & saw liberal & higher Ed & Biden. God I wish I could be so lucky to be so ignorant & disrespectful at once & get paid to do it. "
Angela Hull,"I'm incredibly disappointed in the WSJ for this, a resource I rely on to have high quality teaching & an honest angle on policy issues. Absolutely appalling. "
Dan R,"Angela, you have spent too much time at a university.  Welcome to the real world."
CURT BROWN,Wow. That was insightful and cutting at the same time! Well done.
Angela Hull,"I worked for 20 years 'in the real world' before I became a prof, now 6 years in. If anyone in my real world orgs had written anything so obnoxious or acted as the author does, they'd have been canned. Perhaps not immediately since revenue matters, but eventually reckonings happen. That, my friend, is real. "
Angela Hull,"Oh and if I'd spent 'too much time' at a university, I'd be using The NY Times or WaPo for class instead of insisting the WSJ can & should be better. I don't waste my breath calling out those media bc I don't expect anything more out of them than what they give. But I do expect more out of the WSJ. "
Dennis Wendt,"This article is condescending, sexist, and disheartening disrespectful to the future first lady. Please raise your standards, Wall Street Journal. Mocking her dissertation by just the title-- even just that is pretty low. Very disappointed to see this passed editors."

KATHLEEN BERKOWITZ,"The title of doctor is a societal convention.  In this society Ed.D. entitles you to be call doctor as does Psy.D., and any earned Ph.D.  Sorry that you don't agree with that arrangement.  As a licensed medical doctor I am not arguing this point out of spite.  When you were being educated many medical schools failed fifty percent of their students.  Now they realize what a waste of resources that was.  They work with the students to help them navigate the system knowing that the selection process for medical schools is arduous.  Does that mean today's M.D. doctors shoud not be called doctors?I find your argument arrogant and effete.Irwin H. Berkowitz M.D."
Mac Moore,"BERKOWITZ writes, ""In this society Ed.D. entitles you to be call doctor as does Psy.D., and any earned Ph.D.""Not in the public square.  When the call goes out, ""... is there a doctor in the house?"", do you really think that they are seeking inventory or academic assistance?What we call each other at work, does not translate into the public square.  The term ""doctor"" in the public square is generally saved for those that can render emergency medical assistance.  Big difference, if you care."
CURT BROWN,"In ""the public square""? First of all, no Ph.D. I know of has ever referred to him/herself as ""I'm a doctor."" It's part of a title earned via academic achievement, not  a description of a  profession. Of course, most people know  that, even in the public square."
Mac Moore,"BROWN writes, ""First of all, no Ph.D. I know of has ever referred to him/herself as ""I'm a doctor."" Exactly!  That is the whole point of the article.  And, i know of no Ph.D. that expects to be called doctor in the public square.  Good point."
Mac Moore,"BROWN writes, ""Of course, most people know  that, even in the public square""No, they don't.  How do medical doctors look different than academic doctors?  If people in the public square can tell the difference, what is the ""tell""?"
CURT BROWN,"You missed the point. In fact, you should  be awarded a Ph.D. in Missing the Point."

If it makes you exit the field, then that's on you.  But, diversity of thought just may be an area that offends.  Try other magazines that won't allow it."
CURT BROWN,Diversity of thought. What does the mean? A license  to say stupid things to people who  pay to read it?
Mac Moore,"BROWN writes, ""Diversity of thought. What does the mean? A license  to say stupid things to people who  pay to read it?""So, any opinion that you don't like is ""stupid""?  Life is going to be a rough ride for you."

Alan Berger,I knew a physician's assistant (PA) with a doctorate (PhD) in physician's assistancy (?) who worked for a medical practice within my hospital system.  He had the patients convinced he was Doctor So-an-so.  I complained to the hospital that this was deceptive as patients would see him exclusively although state law said patients need to be evaluated by MD or DO 'doctor' at least 1 in 3 visits.  The hospital administration 'blew me off.'  I see that as a problem.  Dr. Jill? Meaningless! Unless she starts to give medical advice; doubtful.  Much ado about nothing here.
Wm Picou,"From my experience, anyone with an Ed.D needs to drop both the 'Dr.' and any mention of the degree if they want to be taken seriously.Of course, if they wanted to be taken seriously they wouldn't have an Ed.D in the first place."
CURT BROWN,"Well, y0u  began with ""from my experience,"" so that pretty much rules out  the rest of it."
robert mckenzie,"Shame on you WSJ for publishing this misogynist dribble from a disgruntled  ""educator""! I put the word educator in quotes because it seems that he is truly not educated at all. I believe he is just jealous that a woman gets the title of Doctor when he doesn't.  He did not have what it takes to  get a PhD, and belittling those who do out of jealousy  and ignorance is reprehensible.  Whoever made the decision to publish this OpEd should be fired. While I understand that the opinion page is not only for positions that we agree upon, going down the path of insulting  every single woman in the country who has worked hard to get a PhD  and has the right to the title ""Doctor"" is irresponsible.

Sharron Hunter Rainey,"In this opinion piece, Mr. Epstein claims to have graduated from the University  of Chicago.  Online sources indicates he attended the University of Illinois.  While Epstein further asserts he was editor of the Phi Beta Kappa journal, he neglected to mention that he was removed from that position by a vote of people who had actually earned the recognition.  Epstein also mentions honorary doctorates bestowed upon Bill Cosby without acknowledging Dr. Cosby was actually granted a doctor of education degree from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  I acknowledge opinion pieces are subject to a  different level of review than pure news, but there are too many problems with this piece for me to ignore.  I have  been a  subscriber for nearly 20 years, and the apparent flaws in this opinion piece makes me question whether that annual fee is a good use of my resources.  Sharron Hunter-Rainey, PhD"

Outside of those exceptions, society reserves the title of doctor for those that can render emergency medical assistance  in the public square."
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Anthony - this has nothing to do with men or misogyny.  Dr. Henry Kissinger, a distinguished Harvard professor with a Ph.D. and extensive publications, served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State.  He was appropriately addressed by  his ""Dr.""  title, as he was using his professional expertise to fulfill the responsibilities required by the positions he held.If Jill Biden holds an official position in her husband's administration related to education, then she should be addressed by her ""Dr."" title, too.

Scott Kenworthy,"The current First Lady is a polyglot - and speaks five different languages.

Alongside her native Slovenian, she speaks English, French, Italian and German.How many languages does Ms. Biden speak?It looks like that skill is much more valuable than any degree in education which has shown itself to be a harmful skill judging by the current level of education in America that these people champion (down our throats)."

Dan R,"The only sexism here is all the cries about sexism.  There would be no cries from the same crowd to support a person who is male who is also ridiculed for using the title of ""Doctor"" inappropriately.  Indeed, it is common to question whether one's use of a ""Doctor"" title is appropriate whether that person is male or female.  "
David Tinkler,"Dan R, the point is that it is not ""inappropriate"" for someone with an earned doctorate to use the term ""Doctor"".   If you want to pick on someone who is using the title inappropriately, try ""Doctor"" Sebastian Gorka."
Dan R,"David Tinkler, Gorka holds a PhD from Corvinus University in Hungary.  Is it appropriate for him to use that title?   You seem to think so, but you are somehow angry about those that question Jill Biden.  Different standards for a man vs. woman is sexism."
Brandon Abranovic,"But her use is perfectly appropriate, so what's your point?"
Julius Pretorius,"Epstein's lack of education is highlighted by this poor product from his pen.  First, the title ""doctor"" for those with doctorates date from the 13th century when the first doctorates were conferred by European universities.  Second, a honorary doctorate does not bestow the title ""doctor"" on the recipient.  Dr Biden earned the right to the title by virtue of her doctorate from the University of Delaware."
Jack Lichtenstein,"It doesn't take an Ed.D to figure out that Joseph Epstein was using Jill Biden's degree as a way of reacting to the sudden prolific use of her title by the media and others swooning over the restoration of ""legitimate"" power to the White House.  It is their way of pointing out that the country is best governed by those who know the difference between constructive learning theory and cognitive learning theory or between a salad fork and a dessert fork.  The rest of us just need to shut up and do what we are told.  As for those who view Mr. Epstein's article as an attack on women, they have done little more than attack Melania Trump for four years.  Their respect for women, as with minority groups, is reserved for those already in their camp.  As for the Ed.D title, I would say ""Use it if you believe you need it.""    "

Dan R,"Chet, nothing like a good old-fashioned misogyny stereotype to make your point!  The true misogynists and sexists are easy to identify here.  The columnist is not one of them. "
Larry Warren,Agree
Larry Warren,"Mastering 5 languages is pretty impressive, how many can you speak?"
Mary Davis,Mastering? She can't even speak English!
chet brewer,"german, russian, japanese, french, italian, whats your point. "
Jack Lichtenstein,"Wow!  A perfect blend of misogyny and political bile.  Thank you for illustrating my point, sir."
chet brewer,"ok again, what exactly has melanie trump accomplished in her life. its not misogyny or political bile, just fact. After listening to the trumpys refer to michele obama as a monkey and being happy that a woman with elegance and class was now in the white house its interesting that now they trash jill biden for having an education and actually earning her way through life, unlike Ms Trump who has done nothing other then use her looks and her body as well as surviving being married to the original misogynist"
Niels Cosman,"I can't believe that someone thought that this was a great idea for an article, the wrote it, submitted for publication, and then it was approved and published my a major newspaper. Is it sort of silly that Ph.D are called doctors? Sure.It it worth writing an article about? Absolutely not. It this article likely motivated by some childish misogynistic butthurt? All signs point to yes. "
Heidi Aronin,"Hard to say which is more offensive - that Mr. Epstein wrote this or that the Wall Street Journal printed it.  The use of the honorific Dr. for those who have earned doctorate-level degrees is still the standard in academic settings, as in the one in which Dr. Jill Biden is employed.  Mr. Epstein, who never worked for nor achieved a doctoral degree, may feel the need to diminish those who have earned this honorific through their achievement.   But he appears bitter and petty when he chooses to publicize his churlishness.  It is this type of pettiness that gives academics a bad name, not the use of ""Dr."" for people who have earned it.  "
THOMAS QUINLAN,"Get over yourself Joe.  If she's got the doctorate and wants it recognized because she went back in her 50's to do the work, that's okay.   Happy holidays.  Dr. Tom (JD)"
Carl Ponzio,"I don't need to reference my accomplishments in the academy to suggest that Epstein's take will be used in classrooms for the next 30 years to showcase a misogynist's dying breadth. His education, through simple time of birth, is inherently better than ours.....and don' you forget it, kiddo.    "
Andrea Martin,"""How can the WSJ publish this sexist, anti-intellectualist rubbish"" My thoughts too. I am canceling my subscription."
JEANNE RODGERS,There are many educated people who agree with this article.  I had a English teacher back in the 80s tell the class to address her as Mrs X as calling her Dr. X sounded pretentious.  One only has to see the results with today's emphasis on education whose goal is therapy instead of learning especially in the elementary and high school curriculum.  
elizabeth helmer,"Jeanne Rogers""I had a English teacher..."" is incorrect. I had an English teacher."
Mary Davis,"You're WRONG. What self-respecting, partially educated adult doesn't know how to properly use articles of speech? (""AN!"")"
Scott Kenworthy,Glad to see you go... I am sure the NYT would love your subscription.
Milan Vego,"Mr. Epstein made an inexcusable error of judgment in denigrating wife of the president-elect. This was an uncalled attack on an honorable and dedicated person. Ms. Biden should be commended for her intent to continue teaching her students despite soon to be First Lady. Mr. Epstein's  focus in his article should have been on  general lowering of standards in  getting Ph.D. degrees and honorary doctorates. Yes! This is a growing problem in this country (and many other countries as well). Ms. Biden has nothing to do with that. Hopefully, Mr. Epstein will avoid personal attacks in his future articles. This is not  only dishonorable, but also highly ineffective way in discussing important issues this country is facing."
Nick Moore,Mr. Epstein officially chose the stupidest hill to die on. 
J Zoll,"Joseph Epstein is 83 years old.  It seems this issue has been on his mind for some time, yet he has picked this moment to raise it, and Jill Biden as his target.   Are there no male Republican non-medical doctors who also disturb him?     "
Mary Davis,Good to know -- let's hope his misogyny dies with him.
K Carroll,"I hope the author's next piece will be an explanation as to why he has not advanced his education beyond a bachelor's degree.  Since it is so easy to get a doctoral degree of any variety, I would love to hear his explanation as to why he quit school after receiving his bachelor's degree.  I cannot help but to wonder if he would have called a man ""kiddo"".  "
Scott Kenworthy,"The author did not state:""Since it is so easy to get a doctoral degree of any variety"".Please re-read the article.And if it were, then it doesn'y mean anything, so why waste one's time on such a worthless goal?"
K Carroll,"The Ph.D. may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards in university education generally, at any rate outside the sciences. Getting a doctorate was then an arduous proceeding: One had to pass examinations in two foreign languages, one of them Greek or Latin, defend one's thesis, and take an oral examination on general knowledge in one's field. ---------The inference is that any doctoral degree that is not a science doctoral degree is easy.  I say to you and to Mr. Epstein, if it is so easy to get a doctoral degree, why doesn't Mr. Epstein have one?  His next piece out to explain his lack of educational accomplishments.  "
Scott Kenworthy,"""His next piece out to explain his lack of educational accomplishments.  ""Too bad Steve Jobs is not still alive to explain why he didn't bother getting a college degree let alone a Ph.D.I seem to remember some other famous wealthy citizens also do not have a college degree :-)"
David Reams,"Epstein, your dismissal of Dr. Biden  is a blatantly misogynist opinion piece.  Addressing any woman, let alone one who has earned advanced degrees and the future First Lady, as ""kiddo"" is disrespectful and sexist.We all understand that little, insecure men need to denigrate women to feel superior but WSJ, please send them somewhere less reputable to spew their hate.  "
Lisbeth Kamborian,"I can't believe my favorite newspaper actually printed this piece by Epstein. How condescending, misogynistic  and inappropriate.  "
Robert Bradford,"One has to wonder if this article would have been written or published if Dr. Biden had been a man. Somehow, I think it wouldn't."
Luis Gonzalez,How plain foolish...
Kristan Jones,"Wow, Epstein. Way to show your true misogynistic colors. Those of us that have a PhD know the utter dedication and sweat that goes into it. I don't expect to be called ""doctor"" every where I go, but in an academic setting, I do. I spent a total of 15 years getting an education, and seven of them on the PhD while another misogynistic jerk gave me his reasons I wasn't good enough. I hope to God you get out of academics, and I am surprised and disappointed the WSJ would let you write such trash. "
Dan Hanrahan,"Joe - Mr. Epstein- Obnoxious and Offensive Writer Guy - ninny: a bit of advice on what may seem like a small, but I think is a not unimportant matter. Any chance you might get over yourself? Broadcasting your crackbrained theories about what does and does not constitute a legitimate PhD makes you sound ridiculous, not to say a touch silly. You quote the proverbial ""wise man"" as saying the only real doctor is an obstetrician. True that. And we must only say ""your honor"" to judges who oversee capital murder cases that involve a parakeet, a rubber ducky and a yo-yo. And the Armed Services can just do away with the title ""Captain"" - unless the officer in question has led troops into battle on terrains involving quicksand and rivers full of water moccasins. Anything else, not legit.  (My full satirical response is up on Medium. ""Is There a Writer on the WSJ Op-Ed Page? Not If You Need a Sane One"" by Dan Hanrahan)."
Bree Sheahan,Kiddo? You lost me right there Joseph.
Carolina Acosta-Alzuru,"How can the WSJ publish this sexist, anti-intellectualist rubbish? "
Joseph Ekstrand,"I'm an MD.  Dr Jill Biden has my explicit permission to call herself 'Doctor'.  She earned that title.  Oh- and yes, I feel the same about NP's and PA's who get a doctoral degree. "
Rebecca Adkins,"Thank you Dr. Ekstrand! I am an NP currently working on my PhD in nursing. I've been practicing as an FNP for 23 years and I am quick to point out to my patients that I am NOT a medical doctor and will continue to do the same after I obtain my PhD. However, I will use the title with my credentials clearly listed. "
David Sims,"Dr. Biden has two things going against her in today's America:  she's accomplished, and she's a woman.  I'm happy to see a woman who's competent and dedicated to making others' lives better using the expertise she's gained not only through experience, but through educational achievement.America used to value reaching ""higher"" in life.  Today it seems we are all digging as fast as we can to go lower than the next guy.   Fortunately, it is people like Dr. Biden who may just be able to bring back a societal respect for learning, expertise, accomplishment, and service.I wish Dr. Biden and her husband well, and hope the country I love will also come back to valuing what made us a great people in the first place.(Hint: it wasn't criticizing those who did things by those who don't.)"
Wayne Longman,"Asked a PhD friend why he went into education.  Smiling, he said it was the easiest PhD he could find."
P H,"So men should call your friend ""kiddo,"" not ""doctor""? Very strange anecdote to share."
chet brewer,"personally i dont put down anyone with a PhD, it takes real work to get one . I am sure you took the time and effort to do a dissertation and can tell us all about it, or are you nothing more then another bitter trumpy who cant get over losing bigly and want to do anything you can to denigrate the biden administration.  Ms Biden is certainly an improvement on the current first strumpet"
W Kroll,A different opinion? Great! That's a healthy thing. A snarky attack just for the sake of being snarky? And greenlighted by the Site? That is the issue. Perhaps someone here can suggest a motive for Epstein writing this other than to be petty and small? 
Bryon Leggett,He has a book to sell and hopes that elderly misogynists might buy it after reading this nonsense.  
George JAMES,"Can't believe the WSJ thought this was an opinion piece worth printing...It's just a Fox News style political attack  on the incoming First Lady with no  redeeming value.   Keep this up and I""ll say ""Hello Bloomberg"" for my business news."
Mac Moore,Maybe diversity of thought is not your bag.  Bloomberg would be a more comfortable fit.
Wesley Hilger,"Referring to someone as ""Doctor"" is more about societal norms. We refer to physicians as ""Dr"" but not others because that is how society has evolved. Dentists (DDS) are dentists, veterinarians (DVM) are vets, Ph.D.'s are professors, Chiropractors (DDC) are chiropractors etc. They can all call themselves ""Dr"" but they do not because typically when you call yourself a Dr people assume you are referring to yourself as a medical doctor.  So, maybe instead of Dr. Biden she should call herself Professor Biden to honor her educational accomplishments. If she continues to call herself Dr. Jill, Joe Biden might get confused and appoint her surgeon general.  "
Bill Goffe,"Dr. has been used by academics for nearly 1,000 years."
Wesley Hilger,"True, and it is an earned title that they worked very hard to obtain.  But, in modern society if you ask most people what they think of when they hear the word ""doctor"", they think of a person with a white coat and stethoscope not a tweed sweater vest and pipe. Perhaps academics need better marketing for their title or they can accuse physicians of ""title  appropriation"" and force physicians to go back to the original term used to describe them, leech. "
Asha KAmat,"Perhaps people should realize that the MD as a doctoral degree only dates to the 20th c, Johns Hopkins, I believe. Physicians have been called ""Mr"" in Britain for a very long time. A doctoral designation only refers to the highest research degree attainable in a particular field, and had nothing to do with medicine."
Robert Bradford,"What utter piffle. It is absolutely common to refer to academics holding a doctoral degree as ""Doctor."" "
Judy Rehfeld,PhD candidates are called Dr...as are MD's. Your ignorance is showing.
Pam Mason,"Please. Chiropractors call themselves Dr. all the time. I googled chiropractors in my area, every one of them use Dr. "
Philip James,"Yes, let us continue to denigrate anyone who seeks to achieve academically.  These people won't be happy until we are back in the caves worshiping the Thunder Gods."
Nick Moore,"The misogyny of this article is on another level. I wonder how Mr. Epstein feels about abstinent priests being called ""father.""""Kiddo""...? Unbelievable. "
Mac Moore,"Nick Moore writes, ""The misogyny of this article is on another level. 

I wonder how Mr. Epstein feels about abstinent priests being called ""father.""

""Kiddo""...? Unbelievable.""Wow!  So much confusion and misunderstanding.First, ""kiddo"" is Joe's pet name for his wife, not some invention of the author's.  Joe patronizes his wife with Dr. Biden and demonstrates his sexism with his pet name, ""kiddo"" for her.  Don't blame the author for it.As for ""father"" in the clergy, no one confuses a real parent with the clergy.  So, i am not sure of your point."
Skip Sailors,I will be proud to be in a country led by an administration that has President Biden and a First Doctor.
M Whiting,What do you expect from a social climber?
Robert Hughes,"The word ""doctor"" comes from the Latin meaning, ""to teach.""  Variations of the word include docent, a learned person.  Originally, I've been told,  the term doctor was limited to professors in medieval university.  But medical practitioners in Scotland took offense at this, arguing they had studied long and hard and were learned too.  Eventually, the term stuck to them as well."
Helen Callahan,"""Kiddo""? Embarrassed to be a WSJ subscriber today."
Dan Caldwell,"The first line where Mr. Epstein referred to Dr. Biden as ""Kiddo"" indicated where this commentary was headed - downhill.It is surprising that the WSJ does not have the editorial standards to screen out this sort of tripe from appearing in its publication.    "
Elizabeth Tate,Appalling editorial! All I learned from this is that the author is bitter and small minded; perhaps jealous of those who earned their Doctorate rather than being awarded an honorary doctorate. Very sad piece and so disappointing that the Wall Street Journal chose to publish it. 
Susan B,"I joined this site today, specifically to comment on this article by Epstein.  His article is bitter, and smacks of sour grapes.  Let's delve into Jeffrey's mommy issues shall we?Like it or not SIR, Jill Biden is your MADAME First Lady!So, suck on that politically correct grape!"
Richard B Finger,"Mr. Epstein correctly points out the deteriorating standards of our educational system.  For announcing that a PhD ain't what it used to be, those from the left castigate him for reporting the facts. Bravo, Mr. Epstein. "
Kristan Jones,Then perhaps Epstein should not be in academics- he seems to be contributing to the decline in standards. Thanks kiddo.
Robert Bradford,"A PhD isn't what it used to be solely because it used to be almost exclusively obtained by white males who studied the work of other white males. The expansion of higher learning to include people of all races, ethnicities and genders who study much broader areas of interest to them is the sole measure of this supposed deterioration in standards. "
Milan Vego,"Mr. Bradford--deterioration of Ph.D.  standards is a fact and cannot, and should not be wished away. You are also implying that lowering of standards is due to expansion of higher education. In other words,  people of of all races, ethnicities, and genders , somehow should be excused for not adhering to high standards in getting their Ph.D. degrees.  The fact is that standards for getting Ph.D. degrees were steadily eroded regardless or race, ethnicity, or gender.  "
richard mertens,"I see the editorial section of the WSJ continues to deteriorate.  I work in medicine and, frankly, when I see kooks like Dr Atlas or Rand Paul spouting easily disprovable 'medical theories' they should be dropping the MD from their names.   You know, WSJ, that opinions do vary in quality based on the amount of factual content an opinion is backed up with.  This writer is some idget whose entire argument is based on his own mediocre educational achievements and nothing more."
Michael Welch,"But you don't refer to Rand Paul as Dr. Paul.  Interesting.  And he is a ""kook"".  Then you revert to ad hominems.  This is getting more comical by the minute"
richard mertens,"Yes, Paul is a kook.  It would have been helpful for him to pull out his old med school lecture notes on epidemiology and germ theory before he spouted off that social distancing makes no difference in the spread of communicable diseases, defying literally thousands of years of understood disease spread."
Michael Welch,"""All these things they tell you to do, closing down the restaurants, closing down the schools, there's no real evidence that they're changing the trajectory of the disease. If you look at the incidence of COVID, it's going up like this - it's going up exponentially despite all the mandates. So, those who say there is science just aren't paying attention to it,"" -Dr. PaulThat is not kooky that is empirical fact, it is science. The virus is spreading despite masks and social distancing which has been going on for months.   Or as one Israeli scientist said when this all started, minus a vaccine it is a virus and will do what viruses do. There is not much nations can do to stop it.Rand Paul is a doctor.  All doctors are not right, but he has more credibility than most laymen.  Even Dr. Kiddo."
Mary Davis,We'll be happy to call him DR. Kook. Happy?
Michael Welch,Sure. And I'll call you Dr. DB.OK? Happy?
Richard H Place,With all  that is going on in the world this made the paper?Why do we pay for this trash?
David Tinkler,What an embarrassment to the WSJ.  How could such a petulant screed get approved by the board of editors?  
John Bartelloni,"Must have been a slow news day 
Mr. Epstein.I have taken classes at NVCC where Dr. Biden is a respected and beloved faculty member.

Keeping the designation will remind others (men and women) of the hard work behind it.

End of discussion."
Joseph Nusser,Mr. Epstein wrote a mean spirited commentary.  My question is why the WSJ asked for and published it?  Except to be mean spirited as well.  
Helen Laack,"Wow! What a slam to all the hundreds of thousands of people who have worked long years to achieve a doctorate in all the many fields outside medicine. Yes, our society has the habit of referring mostly to our health care providers as ""doctor,"" but an earned doctorate in any area definitely allows the use of this honorific whenever that person chooses to use it.An ""honorary"" doctorate such as the author claims? That is a totally different situation, and not one that DR. Biden is leaning on. Glad to see a DR. in the White House!"
RICHARD LIPSKY,"The level of hyperbolic vitriol for a rather silly Op-ed is remarkable. Seems like a lot of folks doth protest too much in their rabid desire to canonize Jill Biden's educational achievements-and by extension cast the outgoing administration in a clearly jaundiced light. When I was going out with my now wife some forty years ago, and had just received a PhD in political theory, she told her Yiddish speaking mother that her boyfriend was a Doctor.  To which her Auschwitz surviving and suspicious Mom replied; Oh yeah? But can he give a kaneh? (Enema)"
Gerald Buetow,"Anyone who doesn't squirm when referred to as ""doctor"" is an insecure egomaniac - regardless of the discipline. It's kind of like ""sir"" when you are a junior officer. While I have been successful in ensuring an end to the former, I was never able to eliminate the latter. Thankfully, that was long ago and that was part of a very different chain of command.  It is comical and predictable that a member of the Biden clan relishes such idiocy. Titular hubris feels about right for this Formica White House.  The entire election was a Potemkin village. Moreover, the content and requirements needed to receive an EdD is far lower than an associates degree in almost any technical field. Many would argue that a STEM based high school degree a far higher accomplishment. The evidence of this is to simply look around primary and secondary administrators and document the stellar decision making be made daily. "
richard mertens,"Having degrees in philosophy, literature and medicine with years of work experience in the mechanical field, I learned one thing for certain---STEM folks have no clue how little they know about anything not a widget.  "
Wayne Longman,"It's OK, we'll have a fake President who won a fake election on a fake platform supported by a fake media there too. "
Daniela Krausz,Must be nice knowing so much more than us.
Markus Naslund,He knows more than both the Supreme Court and Bill Barr. He's a brilliant mind that Longman.
Dan Mobey,"What a shame to actually get educated people into the Whitehouse.Wonder what photos of Dr Biden we'd find if we searched, like Melania's which were a tribute to the classless couple leaving... Finally."
Robert Chase,"Psssst.....Dan, it's the White House"
Tim Barry,"I am a ""real doctor"" (MD, grad 1967 Harvard Medical School). I want to be called ""Doctor"" when I work in a hospital, or by patients if they are not social acquaintances as well, but not by friends or colleagues or in other settings, unless perhaps being introduced before giving a talk or speech. I suggest that we all use such titles only in our professional settings. Most MDs in Congress (17 just now) seem to go by their given names ""Rand Paul"", etc. Different publications have their own style sheets, but it seems to me that minimizing such titles is appropriate in general writing. For MDs, If a discussion concerns medical issues, especially in your specialty, you might remind others of your background so as to be held to a higher standard! But even then, expressing your opinion should be accompanied by a summary of the consensus of your colleagues even if you disagree; that way you do not pretend to represent all your colleagues or the medical field generally."
Mary O'Gorman,You've stated your preferences. Dr. Biden has hers. 
Karolyn Benger,"First of all, Dr. Biden is a Phd, ergo, she is a Doctor. Second, you may also refer to her as Madam first lady. However, you may, under no circumstances call her kiddo. That is disrespectful, rude, and overly familiar. More importantly, I am shocked that the WSJ has stooped so low as to publish this drivel.  I am reconsidering whether or not to renew my subscription.  "
Richard Behun,"She earned it and has the right to use it.  This paper likes to say they are unbiased, but this clearly shows the true colors.  There was no reason to highlight this.   Next you might say advanced degrees from different ""quality level"" schools should always be highlighted.  "
John Bartelloni,Got that right.
Carol Littler,"Would an opinion piece  such as this ,  which denigrates education ,  be written about a White man, Black man or a Black woman? Let alone published? I think not.   But, the WSJ Editorial Board seeming thought this piece was appropriate as the subject was about a White, blonde woman.  The opinion piece speaks volumes about the author, none of which is flattering..."
Monique Giroux,"Well there really are a lot of stupid men who think very highly of themselves, right, jealous joe? Shame on WSJ for printing this nonsense.  I just cancelled my subscription.  Why pay when you can get this kind drivel for free on Twitter."
greg abel,WSJ has lost credibility as a legitimate news source
Michael Welch,It is an opinion piece.
Suzanne Perry,"True, but opinions like this taint the news side. A WSJ reporter tweeted today about how difficult it is to be associated with a paper that would print an opinion like this."
Robert Chase,Well there's always the New Woke Times
Joe Hanlon,"Why would you take the time to right this, and why would the WSJ publish it?  Pure trash, plain and simple."
christine petersen,Sad to see the wsj turning into newsmax. Adios boys.  
S Zell,All degrees should be praised as they show accomplishments.  Hunter Biden has Juris Doctor.  So does Rudy Giuliani.  So they should be called doctor as well.  
richard mertens,And they likely sign their names to certain documents with 'J.D.'  
Adam Tatar,"Mr. Epstein - this is what the kids call ""getting ratioed."""
Sean Casey,"I think this Epstein may be a Jeffery type. This is a coward's take, and his editor should be fired for letting such trash reach a reputable publication."
rachel weller,"What a load of garbage, WSJ. The fact that you thought an op-ed onthis topic deserved space is disappointing. And ""kiddo""? What was that about. Disrespectful ON PURPOSE. . "
William Crawford,I expect to see an explanation of why this misogynistic trash made it to print. My continued subscription depends on it.
B GREEN,Why would WSJ publish this aimless screed from a nobody nursing an inferiority complex? Was Dennis Rodman unavailable to write an op-Ed this week? 
John Bartelloni,Dennis Rodman was too busy negotiating with North Korea and Captain Bone Spurs was unavailable because he was soiling the ground at USMA with his very presence.
Cheryl Gardner,Can't the author find something important to quibble about?
WILLIAM EARLY,"This is part of the ongoing anti-intellectualism that seems to become more more and more pervasive.  A doctorate should be celebrated, not minimalized.  This editorial is ridiculous and the WSJ should be embarrassed  to have published it and should apologize.  I am a medical doctor and I and my peers have never looked down at our PhD colleagues and would never think that their use of the doctor title is self aggrandizing.     William Early, MD"
David Sims,"Completely agree that a doctorate should be celebrated.  All learning and accomplishment - at any level in any field - should be celebrated, and expertise should be sought rather than ridiculed.  Thank you, I appreciate your comment."
Mary Davis,"Spoken like a secure man. Thank you, Doctor."
S Zell,All lawyers have Juris  Doctor.  All lawyers are doctors.  
Nicole Hamilton,Not true.  Some get an LLB.
S Zell,"Majority of lawyers have JD.  Foreign lawyers may have LLB.  So Dr. Rudy Giuliani, Dr Hunter Biden."
Nicole Hamilton,"Harvard was still granting LLBs until 1969. Anyone with a doctorate of any kind is free to insist on being called ""Dr."" and others are free to decide how to respond.  Generally speaking, if I know someone prefers to be addressed in a certain manner, I try to accommodate.  Being polite and respectful costs me nothing. I don't have a lot of interaction with Rudy Giuliani or Hunter Biden, so it's unlikely I'll need to decide whether to call them ""Dr."""
Vicki Mutino,"No, lawyers are usually referred to as Esquire. They're not referred to as Dr.  unless they have achieved Doctor of Juridicial Science - JD degree. "
Corina F,"Bitter much Mr. Epstein? At best this is worth sharing during happy hour,  after a few drinks."
Dan R,"Maybe we should call Joe Biden ""Doctor"" also.   Indeed, he does have a Juris Doctor degree from Syracuse University College of Law where he was ranked 76th out of a class of 85.   "
greg abel,Enlightening
Nicole Hamilton,"What many readers obviously don't understand is that a PhD is a ""higher"" degree than an MD.  An MD is a professional degree, like an MBA or a JD.  A PhD is a research degree.  When  anyone with multiple degrees lists their degrees, they go in order of importance, starting with the bachelor's.  If they have both an MD and a PhD, the PhD goes after the MD because it's more important."
Dan R,"Except that Jill Biden has an Ed.D. degree, which is not even close to a PhD."
Nicole Hamilton,"Okay, so it's like an MD."
Edward Nunez,Epstein has no right to ever patronize anyone with a doctoral degree. Let's see him apply to a doctoral degree and see how well he holds up.   
Edward Nunez,"Dan, do you have a Ph.D.? My mom has an Ed.D. degree from the University of Michigan. I have a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. I saw the work she did as a graduate student--all the while raising four daughters and commuting two hours to Ann Arbor.  Any doctoral degree is an arduous, time-consuming undertaking and is worthy of respect."
Dan R,"@Edward Nunez, I do have a PhD and have been on PhD candidate's committee and was a faculty member at a Medical School.   PhD degrees are a mark of serious scholarship in almost all fields and have been granted since the 12th century in Europe.  The Ed.D. degree is only granted in Education departments and only since the 20th century.    PhD degrees require people from outside fields and departments are on one's committee to ensure high standards are met.   I do not believe that this is true of Ed.D. degree. "
Nicole Hamilton,"I don't have a PhD.  I wish I had gone on to get one but no one was encouraging me at the time, I was tired of being poor, and I also had the impression a PhD had to be man on the moon, or invent the light bulb kind of stuff and I didn't think I was good enough.  Now, at 70, I'm faculty at Univ of  Michigan in the CS department, so I've had a chance to sit in on several final defenses of successful candidates.I wish I had known then what I know now. It is not man on the moon or invent the light bulb kind of stuff.  It is what you'd expect from a really good student as their first really serious project right after their bachelor's.  (Anyone who's hired a  fresh graduate has to know what this means.)  They are not that good yet.  Anyone good enough to get into a program should definitely be able to do it.  I have a lot of really good students and I try to give them the encouragement I never got:  Yes, you can do this if you want."
Vicki Mutino,"I'm sorry, on what planet did you receive your PhD? "
David Sims,"An EdD is a research and professional doctoral degree in the field of education, designed to address real-world issues, as opposed to the PhD, which is of a more theoretical nature.Both are doctoral degrees, and at most institutions there is an almost complete overlap between curriculum and dissertation requirements for the two degrees.  Some institutions offer an EdD, some a PhD, and some both.Your assessment is ""not even close."""
Elisabeth Weinstein,"Weak men, such as the author, are terrified of educated, intelligent and powerful women. By comparison, it reminds them of their own inadequacies and (ahem) shortcomings. If you go to college for on average 8 - 10 years, and delivered your doctoral dissertation, earning your degree, then you deserve to use that title. 
And FWIW, Jill has delivered children, her own. 
"
Maria Thompson,"Wow, if you think a Ed.D. from U Delaware is ""powerful"", you are really cheapening all of us educated women."
John Bartelloni,Your elitism is showing.
Ash Rock,This is such utter disgusting garbage - what a disgrace that WSJ thought this was worthy of publication.  Good reason to rethink WSJ subscription as a female.
Mac Moore,What on earth does this have to do with gender?  Why is it that Lefty's always drag everything down to the superficial of gender or skin color?  I just don't get that fixation.
Jeffrey Bradford,"Sir, Perhaps Mr. Epstein should be reassigned within News Corporation from the Wall Street Journal to the New York Post where his disdain for intellectual achievement would find a home and be more fully appreciated. Sincerely, Dr. Bradford"
Christopher Hoffman,"It seems to me this is an attempt to create meme fodder. I suspect we will for the next four years see a  unceasing fire hose of memes, jokes, sarcastic asides and snarky zingers making fun of Jill Biden's doctorate, all of which will send GOP audiences into gales of laughter and cheers. (sigh)"
DONALD  P SCHLUMP,(Sigh) kind of like what Melanie Trump has endured for the last few years. 
Mary Marsella,Misogyny at its finest.
John Duarte,"""Dr Jilly and President Joe."" as The Who may be paraphrased to. "
Edward Nunez,"Why do you need to patronize this lady? Seems to me that, underneath it all, you're a little scared of smart women.... "
Nicole Hamilton,Completely churlish.  Go find something important to complain about.
JAMES LEWIS,And Epstein didn't get beyond a BA.  WSJ should have never allowed this sexist opinion air time.
John Bartelloni,Got that right.
Richard Sherman,"Shame on you for writing this and shame on the WSJ for publishing this.   This is not an honorary degree, Dr. Biden worked for that degree and as such she deserves the title Doctor.   This is nothing more than anti intellectual drivel and it needs to stop.   For some reason Americans have been taught to be afraid of education and look down on the educated.  Look at where it has led us:  Antivaxxer, Q-Anon, Trumpism.   We need to recognize and honor those that have sacrificed and worked  so hard to be experts in their fields.  "
Christopher Fox,The 'experts' have failed so often that the word itself has become a pejorative; I cringe every time somebody is cited as an 'expert'.
Dan in Virginia,This sexist diatribe by a man with an honorary doctorate that seeks to diminish the academic credential of a distinguished woman who actually earned it is unfit for publication in the Wall Street Journal. This is a sexist and blatantly political attack and should be removed immediately!
ERIC AYERS,"WSJ, please explain, ""Why did you publish such a petty piece?""  It makes me wonder if your editorial board's judgement is as out of date as Adjunct Professor Epstein's."
Ken Schaefer,An opinion from a man who did not earn it toward a woman who did. I was under the impression that conservatives value hard work and achievement. Perhaps I was mistaken. Dr. Biden earned the degree and the title. 
Mac Moore,"Schaefer writes, ""An opinion from a man who did not earn it toward a woman who did.""An honorary doctorate is not earned?  Wow!  Since when?
"
Brandon Abranovic,I'm pretty sure since always? It's more an award than a degree.
Mac Moore,"Abranovic writes, ""I'm pretty sure since always? It's more an award than a degree""So, the award is unearned?  Bizarre logic.  How does that make any sense?"
Edward Nunez,"Since the 13th century, to be exact.  An honorary degree is simply that: an honor. "
Mac Moore,"Nunez writes, ""Since the 13th century, to be exact.  An honorary degree is simply that: an honor.""huh?  if the honor is not earned, why is called an honor?  Your comment makes no sense."
Ike A,I don't  think hard work and achievement are appreciated anymore in today's conservative movement. Look at trump who needed someone else to take his SAT and who played more golf while in office than any of his predecessors. He is used to living off of other peoples hard work. Epstein likes to drop the name of the elite university where he taught but couldn't put in the hard work needed to earn his degree.
Mac Moore,"Ike A writes, ""Look at trump who needed someone else to take his SAT and who played more golf while in office than any of his predecessors""Huh?  Where do they teach this nonsense?  So much hate that all you can see is the superficial world?What is it with Lefty's that their hate corrupts their ability to think.  Trump has less soldiers coming home in body bags, peace breaking out in the ME, lowest unemployment for all demographics on record, fastest vaccine to market in history, prison reform, Enterprise Zones, a robust economy that is fighting back no matter the artificial recession being inflicted by Democrats.But, you are focused on gossip and how much golf he plays?"
Ike A,"I am a proud Republican and has been for the last 50+ years. A Reagan Republican who believes in God, Country, Family Values and fiscal conservatism! I have not seen much of this in the current leadership. The assumption that anyone who speaks up for decency and respect in public discourse has to be a democrat is the bane of the current Republican leadership."
Brian Gunning,"Great article. Shining a light on the veneer and vanity of the incoming administration with its false Gods and prophets. But like any veneer, you only need to scratch the surface   to see the falsity below."
Elisabeth Weinstein,"You seem triggered by intelligent and powerful women? Poor delicate flower, I hope you find your safe space!"
Brian Gunning,As long as the person guiding me is an expert or better yet a doctor.
Monique Giroux,Maybe a true God? or Goddess? or Prophet?  I'm sure someone will help you out because you definitely need guidance.
Brian Gunning,Yes a true God.  I know that offends the Left and challenges your Green God. So telling when the left doesn't like an opinion attack the person and their beliefs. 
Mac Moore,"Weinstein writes, ""You seem triggered by intelligent and powerful women?""What on earth does Biden's sex have to do with this?  What is it with Lefty's that no matter the topic, all they see is gender or skin color?"
KEVIN SMITH,"The origin of the word doctor is the Latin word docere, which means ""to teach.""  Learned persons who use their advanced degrees to teach others actual have more claim to it than medical doctors.  "
Mac Moore,"SMITH writes, ""Learned persons who use their advanced degrees to teach others actual have more claim to it than medical doctors.""So, when the cry goes out, "".. is there a doctor in the house?"", you think that they are just doing inventory or seeking an academic assist?  Bizarre."
KEVIN SMITH,"Are you suggesting that some random person is going to be wandering around the White House in the middle of a medical emergency, wondering if a doctor is present, and might be confused by her title?  Or that a person is going to bust into Dr. Jill Biden's classroom and mistakenly ask her for medical attention?  Is there an actual situation where this would be confusing?"
Mac Moore,"SMITH writes, ""Are you suggesting that some random person is going to be wandering around the White House in the middle of a medical emergency, wondering if a doctor is present, and might be confused by her title?""She doesn't reside in the WH.  So, your comment makes no sense."
Mac Moore,"SMITH writes, "" Is there an actual situation where this would be confusing?""Yes, in the public square, where citizens are outside of their professional surroundings.  Prior to this election, most citizens thought Dr. Biden was a medical professional, since the public commonly understand the term ""doctor"" to mean medical professional when used in the public square."
WILLIAM MINTZ,"My friends and I discussed this issue 50 years ago, when we were sophomores in college. It was sophomoric then and it is sophomoric today. "
Susan Booz,"Using the title ' Dr. ' indicates an MD, a medical doctor, to many people. I don't pay much attention to this 'stuff', so I'm one of those who made that  assumption. Having found out otherwise, then absolutely Mrs. Biden should stop using that title.  Even if it's technically accurate, it is totally misleading.  "
Brandon Abranovic,"It indicates that to people who do not know any better. Doctor comes from the Latin verb ""to teach"".  Physicians usurped the title from academics so that they could sound more important and garner more respect than they had back in the day.  Perhaps I am mistaken, but I don't remember physicians performing their jobs in lecture halls, so calling them ""doctor"" seems incorrect. ""Doctor"" should be reserved for academic doctors and physicians should be called, well, physicians...."
Mark Menard,"Exactly. Physicians have ursuped the title of ""doctor"" - and they don't have universal claim to the title. We should refer to them as physicians. "
christine petersen,In the UK practicing medical doctors refer to themselves as consultants. 
Elisabeth Weinstein,"So because you are ignorant to the proper usage of a word in the English word, Dr. Jill Biden should stop using it correctly? Okay, got it...."
Mary Davis,"It's only 'misleading' to people who are unsophisticated, uneducated, or petty."
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.The Germans are probably the the most insistent on use of titles. Here's a quote from a 2008 Washington Post article about it:WP: The proper use of honorifics is no small matter in Germany, a society given to formality where even longtime neighbors insist on addressing each other using their surnames. Those with advanced degrees like to show them off, and it is not uncommon to earn more than one. A male faculty member with two PhDs can fully expect to be called ""Herr Professor Dr. Dr. Schmidt,"" for example.That's kind of silly, if you ask me, but the Germans obviously have far more serious problems than excessive use of titles.Similarly, the issue of Jill Biden's use of her ""Dr"" title is of no importance, compared to Joe's mental decline and corruption, along with the influence that Democratic crazies will have in his (or will it be Jill's?) administration."
Lynne Cribari,"Mr. Epstein, Dr. Epstein, or whatever you wish to be called, this topic screams of your own insecurity.  The editorial is a waste of space when so many important topics could have been addressed. Not sure we should be calling you a journalist."
Brian Beams,"What a sexist piece of drivel that should never have made it past the editorial board.I like how the author claims Doctorates are so easy to get now when he himself has never gotten one. He has no idea the amount of work that goes into it, and his opinion reeks of arrogance. Why are we, as a society, waging war against academics? Its no wonder innovation has stalled in this country."
Gerald Ference,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.""She has already delivered Joe Biden.  What more can we want?"
Rebecca Korach,If Mr. Epstein wants to start a movement to rename the titles of all but medical doctors it should not start with a takedown of the new First Lady who is a role model for working women and a voice for educators. While I often disagree with the opinions of the WSJ I generally respect them.  This piece however discredits the WSJ and I can't help but wonder if the opinion page editors  expected and welcomed the controversy to pander to the conservative base. 
Patrick Sullivan,"I'm not prejudiced (some of my best friends have doctorates, even from Northwestern) but ask legitimate academics and they'll tell you that degrees in 'education' are the dregs of scholarship. And, as Epstein notes, the title of Dr. Biden's dissertation is a dead giveaway. I've gotten prizes from boxes of cereal that were more valuable.Btw, anyone who has followed Epstein's career, and read his numerous essays, knows he is a legitimate academic. He didn't get to be the editor of the American Scholar because of his credentials, but because of his abilities."
christine petersen,Not prejudiced but definitely jealous. 
Sai Mohan,"I am just wondering the qualifications / credentials of opinion writers that WSJ hires. There are about 3000 people dying a day, and the thing that bothers this petty minded Epstein is the prefix in the future first lady's name.  The author clearly is very comfortable, on the other hand, of a self-claimed successful businessperson as with most bankruptcies . "
Jim Walsh,This article was about Jill Biden's use of the title Dr outside academia. There are lots of other places to read about Covid. 
LESLIE KELLER,"This article was about Jill Biden's use of the title Dr outside academia. Since she is in academia, I assume that you meant using the title in social contexts or when the professional title would seem out of place? Did Mr. Epstein give any examples of Jill Biden doing that?"
Mac Moore,"KELLER writes, ""Did Mr. Epstein give any examples of Jill Biden doing that?""No need.  Almost everyone has heard Joe refer to Jill as Dr. Biden.  It is common.  I think it a bit patronizing, but Joe is famous for being patronizing."
Jim Walsh, It's the news media that is responsible. Read any liberal rag and they refer to her as Dr. As a teacher Ms Keller should be offended that they don't think enough of Jill's career as an English teacher that they need to pump it up. Talk to them if you don't like the fact that Jill is being mocked for it. 
Mac Moore,"Mohan writes, ""There are about 3000 people dying a day, and the thing that bothers this petty minded Epstein is the prefix in the future first lady's name.""This isn't a medical journal.  Your petty need to demand only single thought articles is absurd.  Don't read WSJ if you can't handle diversity of thought.  Maybe, NYT, LAT or Time magazine is better suited for such sensibilities."
Patrick Sullivan,"I would suggest that someone who can't write a coherent, three sentence, comment would be wiser not to criticize anyone for their opinions. Especially the former editor of The American Scholar, who has published so many books Wikipedia doesn't even try to list them."
Robert Grow,"Does she call herself ""Doctor"" or do some people call her that? I suspect it's mainly, if not entirely, the latter."
Jim Walsh,Probably right. The liberal media couldn't promote plain Jill as a simple English teacher.  They needed to make her special by conferring a title outside its professional circle. Liberals were embarrassed by plain Jill so they gave her a title and use it inappropriately.
Ra M,"She has a degree called ""Dr in Education"". "
Mac Moore,"Ra M writes, ""She has a degree called ""Dr in Education"".""And, rarely recognized in academia, much less public.  In the real world, ""doctor"" is reserved for those that can provide life-saving aid in an emergency.Or, do you actually think that when the cry goes out, ""... is there a doctor in the house?!"", they are seeking academic advisement?"
LESLIE KELLER,"The liberal media couldn't promote plain Jill as a simple English teacher.  They needed to make her special by conferring a title outside its professional circle.In my 16 years teaching in public schools, it has been routine to refer to educators with Ed.D degrees with the ""Dr."" honorific. I don't understand your point other than to make a dig at liberals."
Mac Moore,"KELLER writes, ""In my 16 years teaching in public schools, it has been routine to refer to educators with Ed.D degrees with the ""Dr."" honorific.""Not in the public square.  It is almost never used there.  Some, exceptional achievers of their field of studies, like MLK, Einstein and Kissinger were referred to as doctor in the public square, but they were exceptional figures that would never be confused with medical professionals."
Jim Walsh,"Right, in the education environment it might be acceptable, but in real world the title refers to a medical doctor, not a doctorate in Ed. I don't think when people ask if there is a doctor in the house they want to see Jill Biden."
Michael Wall,"Of all the subjects in the world about which to write, the WSJ editorial staff pay this guy to write a piece that exposes their inherent sexism and entitlement.  Meanwhile, WSJ editorial copywriters, what about your country's free election being put under siege by a large group of Republicans? Somehow that's off your radar. Thankfully, the WSJ has great journalists that so far have been able to continue reporting objectively and comprehensively. "
Jim Walsh,"Dr Jill Biden is a plain ole English teacher, nothing more or less. It's a fine and respected career, but it's not enough in liberal circles. On CNN they were telling us how bright and accomplished she was and they emphasized the Dr title.  I looked it up. She has been an English teacher her entire career. The liberals viewed her real accomplishments as insufficient, so they puffed them using a fancy title that is meaningless outside academic circles. It is an attempt to dress up the person and fake and insincere as most liberal activities. As usual liberals only have themselves to blame."
John Bishop,"Historically, the title ""Dr."" was used exclusively for Ph.D.s and those practicing medicine were considered to be misappropriating the term.  To some, especially in modern usage in the US, the terms ""doctor"" and ""medical doctor"" have become synonymous. I typically consider this a sign of benign ignorance, but that does not seem to be the case with Mister (Mr.) Epstein.  I am honored however by Mr. Epstein's generosity in potentially finding my Dr. title valid:  while not an MD, I have a Ph.D. in a physical science from a prestigious university, earned while I was between the ages 22 and 28.  Am I entitled to use ""Dr."", Mr. Epstein?  Irrespective, I'm more comfortable being called by my first name or ""Mr."" and generally let this be known if addressed by ""Dr."" But this is not because I don't feel entitled to be called ""Dr."", it's because I'm more comfortable with such informality in general.  I think we have more important things to think about, Mr. Epstein, than Dr. Biden's degree."
wendy baker,"Let me get this straight. Mr.Epstein would like us to get back in our old timey way back machines  when doctoral  degrees meant something because they weren't awarded  to women  and   Black  women in particular?   When there was  a ""secretary""  proctoring  exams ? You seem  to be conflating honorary degrees  with degrees earned  at institutions you deem  inferior. I have delivered  other women's  babIes  (DON'T  EVER CALL ME  KIDDO ) and I'm  fine with Dr.  Jill Biden  using the title.  Maybe  you  shouldn't write opinion pieces about women unless you've pushed a baby out of you. "
Mac Moore,"Wow!  You seem awfully hung up on skin color and gender.  What's with that fixation and what on earth does it have to do with the difference between doctor as a profession and doctor as an academic achievement?And as for ""kiddo"", that is a pet name that Joe sometimes calls Jill, similar to his calling her Dr. Biden. "
Michael Quinn,"Was her PhD legit? OK, just like her husband's claims that he finished at the top of his law school class; when in fact, he was near the bottom."
John Bartelloni,"Kindly define ""legit."""
LESLIE KELLER,"Read the article? Her degree is an Ed.D. Yes, it is ""legit""."
Katie Silver,"You could have written anything else, but here we are. Yikes."
Margot Berman,"Dear Mr. EpsteinI was feeling a little unmotivated studying for my finals even though I plan to enter a PhD program for Political Science but this article reminded me that no matter how hard I study, some sexist old man will tell me to drop my title anyway. So what's even the point? I guess I'll go bake some cookies now and buy a minivan.Sincerely,A 20 year old female college student"
Jim Walsh,I see the poli science major has learned the art of calling names rather than debate the issues. 
LESLIE KELLER,What issues? This whole article was rather pointless.
Mary O'Gorman,Ignorant and offensive.  Apparently aimed at those  who are socially and educationally limited to make them better.  Why is the WSJ printing this trash talk?
bruce miller,"Or, more appropriately, aimed at those with pretensions of adequacy who insist on grasping for outsized recognition of their limited accomplishments.      Many of those commenting on the offensiveness of the grandiose moniker are far more educationally and socially prominent than the faux ""doctor."""
Mary O'Gorman,"""Dr."" is entirely appropriate for someone with a doctorate. Those who would tear that down are embarrassing themselves with pathetic attempts to undermine."
Bob Washick,"Kent Jackson followed three clients I worked with, Rewriting the Brain following a 78, 7 and a 23 year old.   All improved in nine hours of of concentrated designs which includes manuscript and cursive writing.   Be assured no schools want the program which improves reading in 9 hours of work.  In reading programs you must be there yearly or until the program runs out.  In a reading program where you cannot read ... you are forced to read a book!  "
Mia B,"Imagine being so triggered over who gets to use the title of Dr.  Thank you, cons, once again for showing us who the real snowflakes are. Well played."
bruce miller,"We are ""triggered;"" just bemused at the outsized hubris and pretension.    "
Hollis Hanover,"I absolutely LOVE this opinion piece.  It so captures the essence of the new Republican base. When  Buckley was the voice of conservatism the movement was smart, logical and interesting. Now it's nose-picking hacks making fun of educated people. Just swell."
bruce miller,A degree in teaching how to teach.    From a field that has presided over the demise of American education from a leader in the 1950s to a laggard today.    Doctor of voodoo?
David Sims,Perfectly stated.
Jennifer Crispin,Yep. Garbage like this really makes me miss Buckley even more.
Vincent Chan,Stupid article. Anybody is entitled to use the academic title he/she earned.
Nathan Donato-Weinstein,"If dr biden and others who use the title ""Doctor"" are not entitled or allowed to use the title, then what is the reason institutions of higher learning, grant the title of doctor to those people who spent 6 or more years earning the title???  Rather presumptuous of MISTER Epstein to be the arbiter of this when dozens of universities, offer doctorates in dozens of speciality fields.  "
Stephen Graham,"I didn't like it when Melania Trump was skewered over petty nonsense, and I find I don't like it any better when Jill Biden is.  If she uses her title to bolster her opinion of the virus or the vaccine, then fine, it's fair game.  But unless something like that happens, it's not relevant."
Mac Moore,"Graham writes, ""I didn't like it when Melania Trump was skewered over petty nonsense, and I find I don't like it any better when Jill Biden is.""It is an opinion piece.  Melania was skewered in front page articles.  Jill Biden is just being scolded for over the top need to be called doctor."
Carla Cochran,"If Jill Biden used her title to ""bolster her opinion of the virus,"" she would be making a false claim.  Her Ed.D, includes neither expertise in health care/medicine nor science."
jorge n,Best opinion piece in months
Andrea Mazzucchi,...imagine the rest
Robert Schreiner,This opinion piece seems fraudulent and even comic. Doesn't the WSJ have more respectable issues to cover? 
Mac Moore,"Yet, here you are, reading it.  It is an opinion piece.  If you don't want to read other people's opinions, subscribe to Time magazine."
Robert Schreiner,"How can I know someone's opinion without reading it? And if I read it, am I no longer qualified to offer my own opinion? I guess your comment is a knock on Time magazine too. WSJ must be too highbrow for me."
Mac Moore,"Schreiner writes, ""How can I know someone's opinion without reading it?""It is covered in the byline.  Is this the first article of your life?  Nearly all articles give up their intent in the by-.ine.  So, to your point, just read the by-lines."
Mac Moore,"Schreiner writes, ""WSJ must be too highbrow for me.""No.  It is probably too diverse for your sensibilities.  Try sticking to single thought publications like NYT and Time magazine.  They won't corrupt you with diverse thoughts."
Robert Schreiner,Just reading the byline instead of the whole article is a very Facebooky way to gain a shallow understanding of the issue. Thanks for letting us know how you process news.
Katie Silver,"Yeah but if they didn't run it, we wouldn't have all had the opportunity to judge the person who penned said article. Or at the very least, give Mr. Joseph Epstein some serious side-eye."
Kathryn Houser,"I thought that I heard that the WSJ editorial staff is striving for balanced reporting of the news.  That may be, but the opinion editor clearly is not.  Pandering to the anti-education and misogynistic strains in American culture reminds us all whose side the WSJ is really on.  The attitudes expressed by this essayist are exactly what keeps American from being truly great.  Americans have great potential, if only we would quit glorifying ignorance."
Mac Moore,"Houser writes, ""Pandering to the anti-education and misogynistic strains in American culture reminds us all whose side the WSJ is really on. ""Typical Lefty logic always boils down to identity.  Not everything has to do with gender or skin color.  The topic is the superfluous use of ""doctor"".  Lighten up on the melodrama.
"
Robert Schreiner,"For Trump supporters, yes everything does have to do with gender and skin colour. After all, the wrong skin colour is what defeated the President in this election."
Mac Moore,"Schreiner writes, ""After all, the wrong skin colour is what defeated the President in this election.""Bizarre.  Trump increased share of every minority demographic votes. - more than any other modern GOP candidate.  So, your comment makes no sense."
Mac Moore,"Schreiner writes, ""For Trump supporters, yes everything does have to do with gender and skin colour.""Really/  Do you have any evidence?  A poll of GOP opinions on gender and skin color?  Or, is this just your hate manifesting itself in imagined assumptions?"
Sarah Grace,I cannot believe this man was allowed to teach our youth. I'm glad he no longer is. Too bad he continues to be given a platform to spout misogynistic nonsense. Shame on you WSJ.
Mac Moore,"Grace writes, ""I cannot believe this man was allowed to teach our youth.""Wow!  Yes, diversity of thought should not be allowed, huh?"
Abigail Hubbard,"This is spot on ... what I have called ""book report PhDs"" for years is what Mrs. Biden has.  As a professor in a business school (now retired), I watched the erosion of PhD programs and saw them devolve to nothing more than dissertatons that are glorified book reports and pud seminars with no rigor.  PhD programs are highly prized because of college ratings (you must have PhD programs to be considered for certain categories), teaching loads are lower for faculty in departmens with programs, etc.  Graduate students have a cushy life, don't experience the rigor and expectations of PhD programs from fifteen + years ago, and, with exceptions, of course, are pretty lazy students, becuase faculty let them dictate terms and conditions.  Many programs are a sham.  We need serious reform in higher education -- clean house, top to bottom.  "
Daniel M,"I was expecting your response to end with the final line of ""...and back in the 'ole days,  my route to school in the morning was a five mile walk. And I had to do it again in the afternoon!"""
Bob Washick,"Gosh.  I hold an Ed.D. Learning disabilities from American university.  No one calls me Dr ...  sometimes, hey You.  At the New York Times were surprised that I used my name.   Why should I not use my name?  So you can say secretly what you want to say.  And the times blocks my comments any way!  However I know Mrs. Biden works with the military and as a veteran... thank you.  There was a veteran and a columnist working for the standard speaker newspaper.  He was riding a bike.  Hit by a car and I screened him in 10 minutes at home and he therefore could not write his column or work.   He was hyperactive and it took 12 hours to work with him.  The program is visual designs where the client with paper and pencil covers 60 sheets in one hour and being processed he will write manuscript and cursive writing.  It is work for me.   Although 3 years for rehabilitation he returned to Work as he could recall writing as a columnist.  Kent was surprised because they did not expect him"
Paul Shifrin,"I have always considered the doctor preface  as an MD. Training as a medical doctor or even a veterinarian bears no resemblance to someone with a doctorate of education.  Like a snooty zip code the education business likes to attach it to everyone with a doctorate for the same reason. Much easier to sell a degree if you can put ""Doctor"" in front of it.Wouldn't matter what gender or race, still applies, and they roasted the author for this article? WSJ a little politically biased?"
Vic Winkler,May the comments applauding the author be remembered as a shrine for legions of ignorant minded fools.
ROBERT TORCHIA,"How about this story? ""Is there a lady with a degree in architecture from an unspecified Slovenian college in the White House?"" Melania falsified her educational background and this author is criticizing our new First Lady for having a Ph.D. and even commenting on her dissertation topic? This is an ill concealed Trumper screed that demeans educational attainments. Why? Because Trumpers are largely uneducated and resent people who have advanced degrees because they know something about history and the rise of dictators. In other words, they don't countenance somebody trying to undo democracy and set himself up as the supreme ruler of the US. "
jorge n,Wow. I would love to see you try to fix a broken water pipe in your ceiling on a cold Saturday night. How's that education of yours going to help?
lydia thompson,"This author of this article sounds like a bitter adjunct lecturer who was unable to advance in academia, and is taking his disappointment out on a woman who has devoted her life to education. What a pitiful opinion piece this is. Enough of the WSJ absurd opinion page. Unsubscribing. "
JULIE NORTHCUTT,"You lost me at ""kiddo"". And then for allowing someone to rift on a job title being used for an UNPAID POSITION.No,  in the year 2020 I am not reading this in the Wall Street Journal.It is not appropriate to call any business woman, and especially our future First Lady, ""kiddo"".  Let's find all the men in political positions and government jobs who have a doctorate degree and actually use the ""Dr."" title, too, and make it a discussion on who feels comfortable using it and who does not. Since you did not do this, let's give this the headline it deserves: ""Insecure Man Doesn't Feel Comfortable with a First Lady with a Doctorate Degree"".Subtitle: First Lady Job Position Should Receive Salary"
Thomas Warr,Kudos for wsj for this controversial opinion.  Its earned condemnation n several msm publications - hence you know it must be good.
jorge n,"Thank you Mr Epstein for writing what I've been thinking since the first time I heard the label in front of her name. Another 1st recently, in my state of Mass.. the governors wife referring to herself as the ""1st lady of Mass"". Please.  :)"
Mia B,"Another first: completely unqualified first daughter receiving the highest level of security clearance and earning the title of ""advisor to the president"". Kudos!"
Mac Moore,"Mia B writes, ""another first: completely unqualified first daughter receiving the highest level of security clearance and earning the title of ""advisor to the president"".Actually, that isn't unusual at all.  Heck, Obama's top advisor was a fiction author!  Presidents are not required to only place Gov't mandarins in their staff.  Is this somehow news to you?  You do know that SNL is not a news program, right?"
John Sandy,"Epstein, an old fart without an advanced degree in anything, was a guest lecturer at Northwestern.  Epstein, who wrote a couple of un-notable essays  during his  productive years, offers us his  opinion on Jill Biden's use of Dr. before her name, a title she has earned and rightly deserves.  Epstein is entitled to his opinion, but it lowers the standards of the WSJ to an all time low.  Is it any wonder that  the WSJ is offering online subscriptions  for pennies on the dollar.  May I say that the Journal offers  excellent news and analysis on politics, business, and  world affairs, but your editorial page is an bottomless pit of drivel."
Anastasia Hattenschweiler,"""Epstein, an old fart ""I don't know what makes you qualified to make this statement except that you must be an M.D., because only his doctor would be qualified to say this."
NANCY COX,Absolutely sexist commentary and can't understand why the WSJ allowed it to be published..  She earned her doctorate and deserves to use the title.  Can not understand why Dr. Biden is being attacked except to be mean spirited. 
Cindy Fryman,Yes Nancy.  It's kinda like when Melania Trump was criticized the year she decorated the White House for Christmas using the color..........red.Tom F 
Frank Hamilton,"The author did not present a strong opinion for why she should not be referred to as Dr. Jill Biden. The author's only argument for her not being referred to as doctor is that she has (presumably) not delivered a baby. He then went on to state that PhDs are easier to get than they used to be, and that honorary doctorates (of which he has) are not presented with rigor. Both these ideas are interesting, but irrelevant to how our First Lady should be addressed. It should also be noted that our future First Lady is more educated than the author himself"
Carla Cochran,"Correction:  Jill Biden holds more degrees than J. Epstein.  That does NOT make her ""more educated."""
Dr. Savanah Lawrence,"But she is, clearly, as seen by the tripe in this article"
Dr. Savanah Lawrence,"She has delivered a baby. A definition of deliver is ""to give birth to."" So now every woman who gives birth to a child shall be called Dr."
GEORGE YOUNG,"Having Dr. in front of your name gets you a better table in a restaurant. When it comes to a doctorate, if you've got it flaunt it."
August Adams,It also makes things more expensive.  Not something one of wants  to share when collecting bids or negotiating a large purchase. 
Cecil Patterson,"The rest of the world knows she is not a real doctor.. Not Joe though,, he always said he wants a diplomat and Dr. in the family..  His life is complete as he has Hunter and Jill. "
PAUL HUNT,With Joes light fingered appropriation of others speeches maybe it will help to have a teacher nearby to edit out the obvious parts. But I agree the title of Dr. Is misleading and pointless.
WILLIAM BOSSEMEYER,"I am proud to have Dr. Jill Biden assume the position of First Lady.  She seems to be a fine person. I admire her commitment to teaching.  I would be interested to know of her research regarding the unique role community colleges have in meeting students' needs - it seems like a promising topic to me because, you know, Northwestern can't do it all.  Mr. Epstein, your criticisms are vacuous, and, the way I read your column, your main impetus seems to be denigration.  "
KENNETH SAILLEY,"Mrs . Joseph Biden is just another example of a political wife's attempt at self aggrandizement to impress the typical core constituency of the Democratic party , professional victims , unionist , welfare recipients , and non producers ."
Mia B,"Like the professional victims who think conservatives and Christians are the most persecuted group on America? Or, like the ones who are always complaining about how the system is rigged against Trump? Or, more like the ones who cry about unfair everyone has been to dear leader?"
Kelly Essman,Unfortunately for the WSJ EB they are running out of opportunities to publish pro-Trump drivel as he spectacularly flames out with his stolen election propaganda and the majority of country is ready to move on from the absolute s-show of the last 4 years. So they are reduced to bashing Jill Biden over her absolute right to use the title Doctor.  What's next? Joe wearing a tan suit? Oh my.  
Douglas Bosnik,I suspect Dr. Jill might be trying to burnish empty suit Joe's credibility as cerebral by association.
Cindy Fryman,"I have a friend with a PhD in education.  Even at an informal social event, such as a cookout, when Bob meets someone new, he informs them that they can call him ""Doctor Bob.""  I can see him using his title at a professional meeting.  We just think he has his head up his you know what.Tom F"
Maureen DiRienzo,Sorta suggests an insecurity.  Poor Bob.  
Joachim Horsley,"This is a op-ed from the stone age. Why is this small-mindedness allowed space on the WSJ? She has earned the right to call herself Doctor because that's just how it works with earned PHDs. Also, the subtle insult to community Colleges is tacky and unproductive. The WSJ reporting is still great, but the Op-ed section is bordering madness. "
JOHN EULING,Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.The petttiness required for this to be written is grade school level. Is Trump the guest editor this week? 
Linda Medeiros,"I understand this is Epstein's personal position but the analogy of an earned EdD with an honorary degree falls flat. If this is Epstein's genuine opinion, not just a misogynist attack on Dr. Biden, why then not also call out all the men who do exactly the same thing? I'd venture to guess even a minimal amount of research would reveal many men in the current administration calling themselves Dr without MD's that Epstein could easily haved name if he wanted to.  Gross."
Peter Duffy,"Having read this column, but not his book, perhaps many folks are like me and would not even consider reading ""Gallimaufry:  a collection of essays, reviews, bits"".Based on this column, the book would potentially be the uninteresting hodge podge ramblings of a frustrated and jealous professor at the end of an unsatisfying career. One can only hope, that the professor is no longer holding court in a lecture hall filled with students looking for nutrition and education. "
James Fossler,"Misogyny is alive and well in this opinion piece.While I have not followed Mr. Epstein, I doubt very seriously that he called Melania Trump ""Kiddo"" in any of his writings.It also appears that Mr. Epstein longs for the ""good old days"" of students passing out during defense of their dissertation.  Surely that could only mean that those PhDs were far more valuable than anything where they didn't have to keep a pitcher of water available for when the student passed out.While I can appreciate someone being very disdainful of ""the younger generation"" and their lack of work in comparison to those ""good old days"" when you had to work for it; it simply shows that Mr. Epstein has not kept up with changes in education and society that have changed our world.When Mr. Epstein has completed his PhD, then he can try to berate or belittle someone for using the title bestowed on them for their hard work.  Until  then, it simply shows a lack of maturity to criticize in this manner. "
Carolyn Quijano,"Currently going through a doctoral program at Columbia, which according to him is easy now? Requirements for my track are Latin and two modern languages (often more, for research), an MA thesis, an oral exam in four fields, 3 years of teaching, writing a dissertation, and a dissertation defense. There will be nothing 'honorary' about my doctorate, just as there is nothing honorary about Dr. Biden's. PhD's spend years becoming experts in their subjects through hard work, and the title signals that expertise. Epstein's point in inaccurately describing then denigrating doctoral programs falls rather flat,considering he didn't bother going through one himself. His lack of self-awareness about why he has mistakenly been called doctor (hello, male in a position of power) while trying to take it away from someone who actually earned it is petty in the extreme. What was the point of this op-ed, WSJ? Are you trying to signal that you're a proud platform for misogynistic insecurity like this? "
Paul Lewis,What a total waste of space. Comparing an earned PhD to an honorary one is absurd  no matter what you think of a PhD. And what about eye doctors who get called doctors? Much ado about nothing. 
Stew Gilgis,Funny op-ed. Good writing. 
Meg Green,You would not have written this about a man. 
Robert Sample,"Ed.D's are commonplace among administrators of both public and private K-12 schools, and few address them as ""doctor"" outside these workplaces. Moreover, a man with an Ed.D who visits his urologist would not correct the receptionist for calling him ""Mr. Smith"" with a snarky reply, unless he wants to be perceived as a pompous nutjob. Usually, a person holding a doctorate in a higher-ed setting does not obtain an Ed.D but in a field of study, and here, too, the term ""doctor"" is often reserved for academic settings. And why would women who hold honorifics be immune from any sort of criticism - even done in jest - for the mere fact that they are women? I thought the whole point of ""equal rights"" meant a person got to take the knocks as well as the kudos.  If anyone ought to be offended, it's the sedate Dr. Condoleeza Rice, who served a long time in government without any TV talking heads referring to her as ""the doctor."""
Sree Srinivasan,"I am amazed by this descent of the usually very interesting Mr. Epstein into such bathos.  Only MDs should call themselves Dr.  Seriously?  He is right in that PhDs and EdDs are dime a dozen these days, but an earned doctorate is called ""DOCTORate"" for a reason.  In a university setting, Dr immediately identifies one as a post-doc (just got their PhD) or an adjunct professor.   Regular faculty members (including assistant and associate professors) prefer the title Professor.  So, Mrs. Biden may herself prefer being addressed as Professor Biden.  I don't know, you've to ask her.  As for you Mr. Epstein, fifty lashes for this silly piece!  Signed: Dr. Srinivasan (my hard-earned PhD is in Chemical Engineering. )"
Ike A,"Why do WSJ editorial  pages  and opinion columns continue to read like 3rd world tinpot dictator's mouthpiece? When I was getting your paper subscription I used to skip the opinion page, but online it is in your face and hard to avoid. Please stop publishing such drivel. And oh, pipsqueak Epstein, kiddo, get an education! Or is that too liberal and for the masses in your elitist view?"
Tony Shaw,Is Mr Epstein a satirist?   
Richard Spears,Let's not forget that the US allows for Doctorate in Church Music - a professional degree no less. So give Jill's EdD  (a research degree) a little respect...because that's all it deserves. 
Michael Koelle,"The decision of the WSJ editors to publish this piece crudely mocking Dr. Biden, educators, and learning itself may have been an effort to cater to those who do not have a college education and feel left out in our society.  More constructive would be opinion pieces advocating for better opportunities for such folks to gain the training and education they need to join the skilled work force and better their lot.  Dr. Biden's work as a community college educator is directed at exactly that goal. We should all be proud to have such an educator in the White House."
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.Could it be that many Americans aren't really cut out for ""college""? Could it be that many Americans in ""college"" aren't really cut out for college? Could it be that many ""college"" degrees are rather worthless?And maybe Biden's promised open borders policy is not actually in the interests of most Americans, especially Americans who are not cut out for college or who are too old for college."
Michael Koelle,"There are a variety of types of training other than traditional college:  learning a trade, on-the-job training, etc.  Community college is one of the options.   I think we should support all these.  I went to a college where the average student was in their late 20's and working full time while going to school part time.  I don't believe Biden promises ""open borders"" - that is a mischaracterization.  My parents are both immigrants, and I work with many talented immigrants.  I expect every American reader of WSJ is descended from immigrants.  "
Jeff Friedman,"When the country is being ripped apart by an election steal fantasy--fanned in part by this publication and its owner--the WSJ chooses to publish a hit piece on President Elect Biden's wife?  This is so low, such a random sucker punch, and such a misguided use of your megaphone--that you should be ashamed.  Of course, four years of supporting Trump means you have no sense of shame...."
Don Peppers,"Incredible. I thought it was demeaning enough when the WSJ went ""all in"" for Trump, despite his odious personal character. But this essay represents the worst kind of snarky male-on-female condescension. Then I remembered the age of the writer, and OH! I get it now, he's just OLD. And he's showing it. Feel sorry for Epstein, folks, he's just lived past his ""use by"" label. And maybe the WSJ is getting a bit stale, too. "
lydia thompson,"WSJ is run by Rupert Murdoch, an old man, who publishes opinion pieces by bitter old men who support Trumpism and anti-democratic power grabs by any means.. WSJ has definitely passed its ""use by"" date. Just unsubscribed. "
Martin Skopp,"There is an arrogance and condescending tone that the author of this article demonstrates. Not all doctors are MDs. You have DOs, DCs, DPTs, PhDs, DPM, ODs, DAOM, etc. Doctor refers to a high level of educational achievement in your field of work/study. We would all agree that in a hospital ER setting, we would all hope that the doctor that is evaluating the patient has the appropriate medical training and is probably an MD or DO. As a new subscriber, I hope to see opinions of value that are more thoughtful and are not demeaning in tone."
Isaac Seliger,"Joe E. is one of the few remaining American essayists, who not only is a great writer and also funny. This is called satire,  which up until ten minutes ago was a hallmark of American discourse.  I rarely met someone with an Ed.D. or Ph.D in the humanities who calls themselves ""Dr."" who isn't a pompous twit. Just sayin'."
Jeff Friedman,"No--this isn't satire.  It is a sucker punch, mean, stupid and not deserving of printing in a national paper.  It is as if the editors asked, ""how can we throw more gasoline on the fire?"""
Michael B,"That's exactly what they did. This is an ""own the libs"" essay, intended to mock, belittle, and demean in the hopes getting more clicks and eyeballs. "
Mia B,"No, this is a transparent attempt by the wsj to increase readership. "
ROBERT BORNFRIEND,"A very enjoyable article and hits the mark for highlighting the phoniness inherent in doctorate degrees. I would extend it to most PhD's also; the holders having given precedence to theory over practical competence. Sure, we need theorists, but maybe not quite so many.And honorary degrees? Absolutely a marketing gimmick."
Joel GRIMES,"I pay the ridiculous subscription fee to this publication because I expect professionally written articles, opinions, and financial outlooks. Why did you provide 15 minutes of fame to this insecure little man? National Enquirer hurting your revenue stream? You might want to consider a couple of PhDs on the editorial board. "
Doyle Johnson,"It seems that the author of this hit piece, having been awarded an ""honorary"" doctorate, feels that anyone with an ""earned"" doctorate should not use the title unless they are an MD.  What a strange idea!  Such puerile writing does not belong in the WSJ."
Tyler Opdycke,"This is what the Journal chose to publish? I've been subscribed for some time with the understanding that the reporting was worth the subversive headlines and page placement, worth the Murdoch money, worth whatever drivel was dreamed up for the opinion section that day. But this is a bridge too far. I'm cancelling my subscription, and I hope all who read this consider doing the same."
lydia thompson,Just did!
Gregory Smith,"What a childish article.  Trump lost. Get over it, move on. "
J Scott Sykora,"I think ""Dr."" as a title on a business card or profile should generally be reserved for MDs.  I think if she carried her degree  as ""Jill Biden, Ed.D."" it would be fine.  I knew many Ph.D.s in math and physics who would normally carry the ""Ph.D."" after their name drawing a distinction with MDs.  None of these folks expected top be addressed as ""Dr."".  The worst case is redundancy: ""Dr. John Doe, Ph.D.""  "
Diego Jarrin,"I cannot believe the WSJ would allow such an opinion piece. Don't you have some minimum standards that opinion pieces must fulfill?Specially when criticizing women, and no less the First Lady Elect for their hard-earned accomplishments?  The author wouldn't have dreamed to attack a man in this way.  Have you ever made the same complaint in the opinion pieces of the WSJ about ANY of the famous male PhD holders the WSJ has written about? Like Dr Kissinger for example?  Double standard much?Also, ""kiddo""?  How dare you."
Gregory Jacovini,"The WSJ is one of the few reliably unbiased news sources in this country.  It is painfully frustrating that it continues to operate an editorial board that is no better than conservative talk radio.  Every single writer at the WSJ should rebel against your current editorial board because it tarnishes their well earned reputation for truth and fairness.  And as for you Mr. Epstein - Joe - fella, what is it about Dr. Jill Biden's title that so challenges your fragile ego?  Is it that she is a woman?  Is it that she is a Democrat?  Is it that she is Italian?  No matter what it is, the painful truth is that had it not been for criticizing her, no one would even know who you are, making you an even smaller man then you were before you wrote your shameful essay."
mike piazza,"Joe E, I got this one for you. An Ed.D degree assures one thing: The holder possesses inflated, fake erudition, and Joe's essay is jabbing a finger in the eye of the degree's pedigree, and those men and women so credentialed who fill the other ""swamp"" we call education. The fact that Dr. Jill is a first lady and a Democrat makes it especially ironic and poignant to conservatives, who shake their heads daily at the incessant lunacy uttered by the ""elites,"" and laugh at all the thin-skinned, pseudo-indignation on display.Also, the Opinion page leans conservative, so get over it."
Mia B,"I thought this was ""satire"". For people who like to ""tell it like it is"", you sure struggle with coherence."
mike piazza,"Just explaining the satire to the Democrats, who lack cognitive skills. Like you. "
Gregory Smith,"What a childish article. Trump lost.  Get over it, move on. "
Dominic Lewis,The level of discourse at the WSJ Editorial Board continues to descend. They are now publishing pointless condescension. A real tragicomedy.The entire board should resign. 
Isaac Seliger,"These are called opinion pieces for a reason and it should be OK in America to make fun of the new Queen Consort. Since Mrs. Biden is a ""Dr."", how about is she is appointed to run the FDA?"
Mark Sellke,FDA? She may be our Acting President.
jes merrell,On a second reading I now must wonder the connection between Joseph and Jeffrey. They both insult and demean the value of women. A front page retraction and apology is required. Will you have the decency? Shame on whoever is the Murdoch's latest editor in grief. They change like a revolving door. 
DAVID MCGINNIS,I thought you were leaving?
jes merrell,"Paid thru Dec so I'll be around,just no further contributions to this misogynistic  rag.Plus I must continue to expouse decency in this Trump infested hole. "
John Burnett,"Why oh why must any criticism of a female, even jokingly, be looked at through the lens of sexism! Come on, girls, buck up. If you want to play in the big time, you need some thicker skin. And yes, I am a member of the ""fairer"" sex.Linda B"
jes merrell,A perfect expression of why Trump and hatred lost.
Daniel Veirs,"What a misogynist!  He should be banished from American society.   He should have to wear a giant red ""I"" on his chest. (for idiot)"
James Stock,"If all of the people who threaten cancellation because of an EB with which they disagreed,  followed through on the threat, the journal would be out of business.  Opinions are called such for a very good reason. "
PATRICIA GREER,"People  ,as i recall this ""newspaper of record"" calls many of the quoted ""experts "" referenced as Dr., be it in economics  or history.  This is a nasty article that belongs in Breitbert."
Peter Duffy,"Mr. Epstein, booby, baby, tough guy. a word of advice. get a hobby. stop thinking, whilst you still have time to enjoy life. silly boy. "
Michael Welch,"Some people need to get over themselves,  it was a bit of fun and a poke at condescending arrogance.One of my favorite stories was from a group of officer that stopped off at a Veterans organizations for a drink. They were all in uniform. The Colonel was obviously full of himself.  One of the members, a veteran, knew his rank and could see his arrogance.  Putting his arm around him he said:  welcome to the club, SARGE.Everybody laughed except the colonel, steam was coming out of his ears.""Those who can't laugh at themselves leave the job to others.""."
Lady Jane,"If you're looking for condescending arrogance, you don't have to look much further than this article as a good example. "
Michael B,It was mean-spirited fun
Gina Cooperman,"So, you admit to having done NONE of the work to earn an advanced decree, whist simultaneously demeaning hers? And, ""Kiddo?"" Really? I wonder if you'd dare to address a male of her stature with the same kind of disrespect. Wall Street Journal, consider my subscription cancelled. If you are going to pander to the aging culture of male condescension and arrogance, I'm done. There's not a woman alive who hasn't had a man try to disrespect her work and experience in such a way. I just assumed that your publication would be far more alert to it. "
mike piazza,"It was an advanced ""decree,"" and it was pretty funny to boot. "
Janice Blunt,"The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of publishing this ridiculous Op Ed that demeans women, educators, and all those who work very hard to obtain higher degrees-- something the author failed to do. He is disgraceful, as is the WSJ for publishing him. "
James Stock,"Although I agree with the premise of this article that using the title ""doctor"" does diminish it's stature when compared to medical doctors and those with other hard science degrees, I couldn't less. And, to insist on using such a title, seems to be ego driven, but she is married to buffoonish Joe Biden who is a known plagiarist who regularly makes up nonsensical stories. "
Toni Vitanza," I am sick of people thinking that studying a ""hard science"" is more difficult than a humanities, liberal art discipline or fine art. It isn't. PS That's ""its,"" not ""it's."" And you meant to write that you COULDN'T care less. "
Jerome Abernathy,"""I am sick of people thinking that studying a ""hard science"" is more difficult than a humanities, liberal art discipline or fine art""Hard science PhD here.  You are correct.  The people saying that are dumb."
James Stock,"Well, since you found a grammar mistake, it's very tempting to not agree with your opinion, but I am still not convinced. "
James Stock,"It's called ""hard"" science for a reason."
Laura Moody,"PhD in engineering here - it's called ""hard"" science because it deals with quantitative measures, experimentation, and math (aka, interested primarily in those things that can be described by ""hard"" numbers). The ""soft"" sciences (along with the humanities, liberal arts,  and fine arts) aren't called ""easy"" sciences for a reason - most engineers I know will avoid dealing with anything related to ""soft"" sciences (especially when you ask them to consider the human in the system) precisely because they are ""hard"" to quantify and even harder to reduce to a simple set of equations."
Patricia Hildebrandt,What does sex have to do with it. I have known several pompous men would have insisted on being addressed as doctor that had PhD's in social sciences. Same thing.
Maurice Hakim,"Given the lack of knowledge exemplified by so many of our youth, I wonder what these  Ed.D.'s have actually bestowed on these students. Our education system is a disgrace. More than half of college students can put together a coherent sentence let alone a paragraph. Sadly, misinformation and censorship is rampant at our best universities let alone the knuckle-headed ones.  Socrates must be rolling over in his grave.  "
Michael B,"More than half of college students can put together a coherent sentence let alone a paragraph.  Sadly, misinformation and censorship is rampant.""Misinformation and censorship *are* rampant. Subject verb agreement "
stephanie johns,"It needed commas:  misinformation, and censorship, is..."
P THARP,"It is so bush league.   But, that's the dems for you!"
Aaron Hart,"When my father first became a PhD he used Dr frequently but everyone found it so obnoxious that he finally quit. Now it's only on his checks. Does Ms. Biden using the appropriate honorific really matter? No, and the fact that Epstein would spend time on her title vs. her accomplishments tells you all you need to know about him. "
Chris CUNNINGHAM,"Really WSJ, the best you can do now is publish nonsense like this? Sad.  "
David Ricker,"This is one of the most stunningly stupid opinion pieces I have ever read in the WSJ.  And far beneath the integrity of the paper.  I am sorry Joe, but you lost me in the first paragraph.  Did you even think about the ""wise man"" line?  Or are you incapable of such reflection.  Male doctors don't deliver babies.  Pregnant women do.  And the best doctors do as little as possible as part of the process.  And by that criteria, Jill's daughter Ashley qualifies her to not only keep the title of ""doctor"",  but the equally important title of ""mother"" as well.  Mothers deserve equal respect.  Even if their sons sometimes grow up to spew garbage in the national press."
Thomas Mcgalliard,"I won't repeat what others have said below. because it has been said so much better.  But I will say, what's the point of this essay?  It's value was close to zero.  "
Kathleen McCook,"Dr. Jill Biden is being condescended to with the use of ""kiddo""--but it's long been a term used by literary men of Epstein's age. The NYT 2019 obit of  Elizabeth Silton ends with a quote from Saul Bellow calling her, ""kiddo."" It is term  used by men of that era. Malamud  and Roth used is as well. Epstein wrote about them all.  They just could not see women as their equals, even the most accomplished."
BRUCE WEINER,What a shame your so mad because you couldn't earn it. Your disingenuous op-ed piece is pathetic. I guess as a dentist I shouldn't be called doctor. How about the neurologist that saved my life. Yeah he doesn't deserve the title. He told me he never delivered a baby.
R Becker,I cannot believe you even got space to write this tirade.  Dr. Biden got her doctorate the old fashioned way--she earned it.
James Coddington,Mr. Epstein should fire his shrink if he (she maybe? yikes!)  has not gotten him over such obvious insecurities as he airs here.
Stephen Shields,"I used to believe the Wall Street Journal was one of the last real newspapers. I expected to see real news and balanced commentary that provided insight into our national problems and clarity of perspective. Now, the WSJ opinion section has devolved into smug, right wing entertainment that makes no pretensions of balance or fairness. Unfortunately, this pandering smears the entire publication and casts doubt on everything they do. Shame on you, WSJ. "
Maya Mallya,"I concur.  As a long time subscriber and an in-depth reader  of this newspaper since 1990, I find it increasingly difficult to comprehend or relate to the mean-spirited opinion pieces.  Now, it is the news and the business insights that motivate me to subscribe as opposed to the opinion pages - a great reversal of sorts.  (M's dad)"
Emma P,"As an MD I have no qualms about addressing Jill Biden as Dr. Biden. It does not diminish my title. But then again I am secure in my credentials and career. All this article does is reveal is that you, Mr. Epstein, are a misogynist (""kiddo"") who considers sexually harassing his students (""read two chapters of Henry James and get into bed. I'll be right over""). This article reeks of insecurity from a man who spent 30 years in academia feeling inferior to his PhD counterparts. Raise your standards WSJ. "
Roy Jacobson,What WSJ editor thought this Op Ed was a  useful allocation of resource?  The Journal should use its space to provoke thought that advances our society;  useless personal critique is a waste at best and an insidious prejudicial jab more likely.
mike piazza,"Hmm. All we've been hearing from the MSM and Democrats the past four years is how much of a rogue, misogynist and liar Trump is -- oh yeah, and how he cheated his way through Wharton. Let us have a little fun now, okay? And maybe, if he read my letter, Santa can deliver a fake impeachment to Biden. And a torn up inauguration speech."
Eugene A. Cooney,"A truly superlative article, Mr. Epstein. Thanks. I can see from the comments that the advanced degree holders in the soft sciences are out en masse to cancel you, but in doing so they merely demonstrate their insecurity and prove your thesis."
Jerome Abernathy,Advanced degree holder in the hard sciences here.  Mr Epstein's article is nasty and petty.  This has no place in civil discourse.  The EB should take it down and apologize.
mike piazza,"Stick to hard science, not social engineering. "
Anton Jones,This post should be removed and the WSJ should apologize to Dr. Biden.
John Cooney,"Epstein, not a good name to have now."
Todd Pinchevsky,"Seriously, can I pay less for my subscription if I promise never to read the editorial page (and this isn't the first time I've made this suggestion. FYI, I've actually cancelled my subscription in the past over their inane and moronic editorials (this was actually the least offensive, just useless), but every time I try to get out, the news and business section PULLS ME BACK IN)!!!!"
Wayne Tamarra,"Really?  What the H E double hockey sticks is the WSJ adoring supporting such a ridiculous editorial?  What's next, commenting on the appropriateness of Mr. Biden's choice of socks?  Underwear?  Good Lord, people with Doctorates have been called ""Doctor"" forever.  The writer and the Editorial Board need to find other occupations,  "
mike piazza,What's much worse is that you referenced Dr. Jill's underwear.  
John Muir,"Even if one were to agree that only M.D.s should use the term Dr., his tone was rude, disrespectful and demeaning by referring to her as Dr. Jill and kiddo.  And why the need to refer to her dissertation title as ""unpromising""?   He just comes across as belittling and rude, which defeats his argument. "
Joan Vickers,"People who have never gone through the rigours of a Masters/Phd or Ed.D write this type of drivel. And males tend to be more inclined than females in not wanting to give credit to women . The fear of intelligent women is pervasive in some societies even today - witness the attacks against girls in schools and universities in Afghanistan, Sudan and other parts of Africa and Middle East.  "
mike piazza,"Well, I have a graduate degree and I think it's funny. Also, reference to the Middle East and Africa is also pretty funny."
Andrew Ellis,"Call the American Museum of Natural History! There is a living Neanderthal working as an opinion writer at the Wall Street Journal.  And, he seems to be unfamiliar with the style policy of the paper. The Journal has routinely used the honorific title of "" Dr"" for hundreds of people other than medical doctors. For example, Henry Kissinger has been referred to as ""Dr"" for the last 50 years in these pages."
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.Let's not forget ""Dr."" King!"
DN dIGUGLIELMO,"Have to agree Joe, I've worked as a Tech Assist. for a number of PhDs. chemists and not one refered to themselves as ""Doctor""..... ""Hey doc my back hurts"", ""well conjugate 2 verbs and see me in the morning."".It's a little overstated."
Andrew Casazza,"Clearly, Mr Epstein is showing his intellectual insecurity at not having achieved such a feat.  According to him, it is incredibly easy to attain a doctorate, but even with that ease, he failed.  Therefore, to make himself feel good, he must diminish the success of others. It's almost like he is stuck in second grade and chanting ""I am rubber, you are glue. Anything you say bounces off of me and sticks to you!"" Grow up, Mr Epstein."
Rick Cunnington,"The Stalincrats at Northwestern ""University"" fired Epstein after this opinion piece was published.  Insecurity? Yes, the Stalincrats are exceedingly insecure. Which us why they so so intolerant of anything outside of the progressive extremist echo chamber of the modern ""university""."
Kent Ford,"This is probably the dumbest, most ill-informed opinion piece I have ever seen in the WSJ. We can usually depend on the Journal for some thoughtful insight. I am amazed that they ever printed this. "
Peter Harris,"One of the dumbest and most tone deaf opinion pieces I have read in a long time. It makes no difference whether you are for or against a Biden presidency. This is just plain blind male snobbery and condescension, with no value whatsoever in the case it tries to make. I am honestly surprised the WSJ even chose to publish it."
Kristin Diehl,"I have a PhD and my place of birth, Germany, where some pretty old universities reside, considers that part of my name. It's in my passport.I believe what really irks this person that HE does NOT have any such degree to his name. Sour grapes. Which we have all seen way too much of. "
Alan Schneider,"It is true that the ""Doctor of Education"" degree is the easiest of all.  You just need to stay in school and take the classes.  It's not like a PhD in biochemistry or chemical engineering.  And certainly not an MD.  If Jill Biden wants to call herself a doctor, good for her but it is a sign of her insecurity.  I am a medical doctor with 3 different boards and never use doctor when introducing myself to patients or anyone else for that matter.  "
Patrick Nicholas,"That's because, as a man, no one is ever going to mistake you as their nurse or the tech. As a woman MD (this is my husband's login), this is something that happens every day to me. Is it is sign of insecurity that I introduce myself as ""doctor"" to patients? No. It's simply the exhaustion of correcting people over the past 20 years. "
P THARP,"Oh, please.  Who's insecure now?"
mike piazza,"Well doc, most of the female physicians today introduce themselves by first name with no titles. You just need to look at the name tag to confirm the suffix. Relax. "
Alan Schneider,"Dr Nicholas (I sincerely apologize if you use your maiden name professionally), medical school classes are now 60% women.  You sound terrific and I still would not use doctor.  Let them be corrected.  Good for you."
Jerome Abernathy,"""It is true that the ""Doctor of Education"" degree is the easiest of all.  You just need to stay in school and take the classes.

Jerome Abernathy,"Nope, my piled-higher-and-deeper is from trade school..."
Jim Holmberg,That makes your education more useful that Jill's.  Or Joe's.  Or Hunter's.
Michael B,"You have to write a dissertation, even with an Ed.D."
Jim Holmberg,I've noticed that many people with actual accomplishment don't feel the need for self-aggrandizement.
Laura Anderson,"...and another thought...Mr. Epstein, you haven't quite mastered the humility you describe in not calling yourself a Doctor of an honorary degree and in ingratiating yourself by telling your reader that you've taught for 30 years at a University with a BA where people called you a doctor, as if these personal accomplishments give you the right to judge and admonish the choices of others.  Placing ""PHD"" on a license plate should merely tell you the level of development and wisdom of the owner.  Finally, me thinks if Dr. Biden was a man, your op-ed would not exist."
LEAH ERICKSON,"I am an educator and proud of it. My ""Doctor of Education"" was granted by Columbia University in 1974. Although I have seldom used the title in the United States, it is interesting how Canada and most European countries I have been to treat ""Dr.""  as a sign of distinguished respect. I am not sure I would treat the author of this article with anything other than distain. Please remove ""Mr."" from your surname as you are much less the man you should be."
CHRISTOPHER BULLOCK,Oh Snap!
Michael Gibbons,"You know that old relative that everyone respectfully ignores at Thanksgiving, as their tasteless wit falls flat? They're not bad people necessarily, but they don't recognize that the world has moved on? Or perhaps their vain attempts at humor are because they actually do realize the world has left them behind?
I would just remind the other youngsters at the table, let's be polite to our elders. They'll be gone soon enough.
"
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.""I would just remind the other youngsters at the table, let's be polite to our elders. They'll be gone soon enough.""Yeah, it might not take long for senility and corruption to bring Biden's presidency to an end."
mike piazza,"How thoughtful. But you see, the joke's on you because the old timers know what they're doing and love to get a rise out of the young nitwits. "
Simon Stafford,"A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.Perhaps that should be him or herself, as Mr Epstien's wise man would confer the honour of ""Dr"" on practically every woman on the planet, as it is they who deliver their child. When we had our second baby, the mid wife didn't get there in time. Does catching my son and cutting the cord make me a ""Dr""?"
Rick Burgoon,Oh please.Just announce by title based on the phonetic of the degree.Ergo...a phud.
ROGER BOYD,Got me humming Dr. Jimmy and Mr. Jim.
Rick Burgoon,This is always amusing.Im a lawyer.  My degree is a JD a Jusis Doctorate. We JDs are technically Doctors but no decent lawyer ever uses that title. Im nit sure what mrs. Biden has done with her doctorate but unless she has conducted research and published and taught the use of doctor is sorta like joe claiming to be president. They are both correct technically but factually? Jill isnt and joe? Well he has a direct line to mr o. to tell him what to do....
Anton Jones,"No you are not a lawyer, not with such a post. I would expect a much better construction of a post, from someone who transacts in words. "
Joyce Felsenfeld,"With all that's going on in this country - pandemic, racial strife, violence, election issues, this is what we're discussing?  She hasn't even moved into the WH and already criticisms begin. What one may choose to call oneself (formal,  casual) is less important than who you are, your actions, ethics, decency, kindness with others. Let's look more at substance than appearance and labels. So disappointed in WSJ and the writer, a petty attempt to demean higher education, women, and an incoming First Lady who I know will do great things for the people of this country. "
Jerome Abernathy,"""Im a lawyer.  My degree is a JD a Jusis Doctorate. We JDs are technically Doctors but no decent lawyer ever uses that title. ""PhDs in education use ""Dr"".  It is the norm.  Outside of education, PhDs use ""PhD"" after their name.  Lawyers use ""JD"" after their names.  If one chooses to be nasty and petty, at least get the facts straight."
mike piazza,"Well, if we're going to be picky, maybe he should get the degree name right: Juris Doctor. "
Lyman Carter,Totally agree.  It is so wrong to have published Epstein's insulting view.
Aaron Hart,Epstein sure knows how to get folks to engage and that's all that matters in todays web driven world. Don't take it too seriously.  
P THARP,"Versus that hard hitting piece on Kammala's fashion sense, which we weren't allowed to comment on...Yes, moderator, I'm sure the fashion sense article was gratuitous and that we weren't allowed to comment on it. "
Ed Baron,"All true, but more importantly, the ""Doctor of Education"" degree is far more laughable than any other in existence.  One ""earns"" it by paying a fee at one door and collecting this worthless piece of paper at the other.  Academic excellence in schools of education is often measured by who brought the most cookies to class.   It's just as fraudulent as the requisite charge of ""misogynistic"" from indoctrinated leftists that immediately followed the publication of this op-ed piece, or the immediate distancing by the university that employed Mr. Epstein.  "
Jerome Abernathy,"""All true, but more importantly, the ""Doctor of Education"" degree is far more laughable than any other in existence.  One ""earns"" it by paying a fee at one door and collecting this worthless piece of paper at the other.""Where did you get your doctorate?  In what field?"
Michael B,You just have no idea what you're talking about.
Andres Saldana,"This article is so outrageously useless, one can only surmise that the WSJ editorial board now has a mission statement  to troll the Bidens, and now begins the slow and steady drip of beside-the-point character assassinations that pass for 'political opinion' at the WSJ. There is no shortage of idle morons who will lend themselves to the task."
Kevin Sorrentino,"Agree or disagree with the premise of this piece (which I agree), leave it to the NYT to now write about this opinion piece as an attack on Jill Biden's gender.   That is why I just subscribed to the WSJ and dropped the NYT.  "
Michael B,Nobody made a peep about Henry Kissinger insisting on being introduced and addressed as Dr. Kissinger. (Harvard GSAS '54)
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Pardon me, but Jill Biden is no Henry Kissinger.  We know of her only because she is the wife of Joe Biden and the  next FLOTUS.  This is not meant to demean her D.Ed. or her work teaching high school and community college students, but to state a  fact.   Dr. Henry Kissinger, a distinguished Harvard professor,  held the positions of National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, so it was proper  for him to be addressed as Dr. Kissinger in these roles.   He has also published extensively.If Joe Biden appoints his wife to be Secretary of Education, then it would be proper to  address her as Dr. Jill Biden.  "
Shawn Budde,When did the WSJ start publishing the ramblings of a senile old man that made everyone uncomfortable at a family gathering?
JOANNE NASUTI,More like bitter old man.  Taught at a university without even a Masters' Degree?  Oh I'm sure he was belittled in his academic settings for years.  
Thomas Erb,"one of the best professors I had, only  had a undergrad degree n Math from MIT and he was teaching Complex Analysis at the graduate level. "
Jerome Abernathy,Teaching assistants also teach graduate-level courses.  They're barely one step ahead of the students they are teaching.
JOANNE NASUTI,"I agree that not all highly educated folks make the best teachers, and some with limited degrees can be the best teachers.  Point I am making is that there is a lot of snobbery in academia and this guy was no doubt a victim of it.  He advertises this sad chapter of his life in this Op Ed.  "
Thomas Erb,"except this guy had a Bachelor of  Science, and was worked at Rte 128 DOD think tank. "
Thomas Erb,"this guy was both practical, and  academic. Complex Analysis  is not for the faint of heart.  "
Trudy Craney,Anyone who dedicates their lives to educating and empowering our youth deserves my respect. Period.
Rick Burgoon,Oh?Aoc?The squad?Hmmmm
Michael Rulle,"I do agree with Ms Craney's statement. As I am sure Joseph Epstein does too. But where I differ from her, is with her assumption that this is what our education system does. I think it indoctrinates and fails to deliver the goods--on average. And ""empowering"" Is only a function of a real education. Not independent of it. "
DON ROSS,"Among the myriad of pathetic ironies that always marks the always screeching left (ala free speech for only those whose opinion they agree with) I would posit the following: The vast majority of those outraged/unhinged by this article are also in complete agreement with policies such as no academic valedictorians named at any level, no test scores used in college admissions, everyone gets a trophy,  equal outcomes not equal opportunities, with no naming/shaming of efforts/achievements or the lack thereof.  Of course, the exception they all would readily agree is in places they dominate like academia, where only by their extraordinary/herculean individual efforts did they obtain the acclaimed credentials that then command them to be addressed as a ""doctor"".  May I suggest a seemingly more consistent approach with their philosophy would simply let everyone call themselves ""Doctor"", after all, it's  only ""fair""?"
ZDZISLAW MEGLICKI,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child. Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.""A Dr is a Dr. It is a title not specifically related to medicine. A man who might have delivered a child, assuming he was qualified to do this, is a physician. He may or may not be a Dr too. If he specializes in cutting live people, he would be called a surgeon. A custom exists to list a person's titles following the name, e.g., ""Such and Such, PhD,"" or ""Such and Such, MD."""
William Moll,"It would seem that Mr. Epstein has more BS than B.A.In the academic world, people with a Ph.D. or Ed.D. are normally referred to as Dr., just as Dr. Jill Biden does.Honorary degrees are entirely different .I don't understand why the WSJ would publish an article of this sort. The phrase ""which feels fraudulent, even comic"" in the subtitle is really offensive."
Maurice Kirschenbaum,"In this insufferable politically correct climate (much more insufferable than the Covid plague) a beloved and incredibly talented literature teacher gets thrown under the bus for expressing that the title of Dr is often used so lightly as to mean very little, if anything. The suggestion of stowing the Dr title in favor of First Lady for Jill Biden seems more than reasonable to me, First Lady being pretty untoppable when it comes to honorific title.  Joe Epstein is saying that these days, some people get a PhD title with very little (and hardly doctorate-related) work to earn it. Pretty obvious and documentable observation. Yes, the Dr title is often silly and even pretentious. Instead, it caused an uproar. Boy, this virus makes so many people cagey and nasty. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"Agree fully.A person who insists people refer to her as doctor reveals an insecurity, a need to impress, to be viewed as special.  It really backfires.  "
Thomas Erb,it's pompous - not unlike  Trump. 
John Cooney,What have you done in your life to judge like this?
Maureen DiRienzo,"I have spent 35 yrs of my life with a PhD, insisting people call me Maureen."
Jerome Abernathy,"""In this insufferable politically correct climate (much more insufferable than the Covid plague) a beloved and incredibly talented literature teacher gets thrown under the bus for expressing that the title of Dr is often used so lightly as to mean very little, if anything. ""That's not what he did.  He hurled a nasty, petty insult at the incoming first lady, demeaning her field and her research.  Not the mention he demeaned Northwestern too.  Where's what the old fool Epstein said:"" ""Dr. Jill Biden "" sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware through a dissertation with the unpromising title ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs.""""Fraudulent?  Comical?  Unpromising?  If I ran Northwestern, I'd remove his name from our websites too.  Epstein has freedom of speech, but not freedom from the consequences."
Jerome Abernathy,""" Joe Epstein is saying that these days, some people get a PhD title with very little (and hardly doctorate-related) work to earn it. Pretty obvious and documentable observation""Epstein is wrong about that.  He obviously has a bug up his bu tt when it comes to PhDs."
Mary Shimko,To say that I was disappointed in the WSJ for printing Epstein's (I won't dignify him by using his first name) op-ed would be an understatement. Clearly he received the attention he sought with it's publication and demonstrated his own academic ignorance. Surely there must be doctorally prepared members on the WSJ's staff who would or should have known how ridiculous and disrespectful Epstein's piece was. Anyone who has earned a doctoral degree appreciates the fact that an MD degree (medical doctor) is a clinical doctorate whereas an Ed. D degree (doctoral degree in Education) is an academic doctorate. Had Epstein been aware of this even he would appreciate the fact that people who have earned a PhD have also earned the right to be referred to as Dr. 
JOANNE NASUTI,He isn't aware because he doesn't even have a Masters but is qualified to teach at a university!
Michael Rulle,"The left has developed this tic of ""cancel"" style language and opinions. For example, Ms. Shimko's general opinion, which I don't agree with, is perfectly valid. But, she has to say ""I won't dignify him by using his first name""--as if he were not fully human--because she disagrees with him. She obviously knows little about ""Epstein""--which is obvious--but she represents the dehumanization movement within the left which cannot tolerate an opposing opinion."
James Coddington,What could be more canceling than Epstein's screed? 
Sharon Stout,"This has been a hard year.   A pandemic, an economic disaster for some who wait in lines for food and a bonanza for others, a long divisive political contest to see which direction the country wants to go.  When I subscribed,  I think I expected to find in these comments an opportunity  for exchange  with others with different political views.   I no longer see any hope of that.  This WSJ  comment forum is coarse by design.  This op-ed is a welcome mat to a sniggering old boy's club.   The flyleaf of the jacket of Lin-Manual Miranda's book ""G'Morning, G'Night""  has these words:  ""Good morning.  Do not get stuck in the comments section of life today.  Make, do, create the things.  Let others tussle it out.  Vamos!""  I am heeding his suggestion.  I encourage others to do so, as well.  For those who count, this is my 7,977th and last comment barring a few already submitted, perhaps still stuck with the moderator.   (Thanks moderators,  for your efforts.)Sharon Stout, Ph. D.    "
EA yke,Well said. Me too. 
Michael B,"Same. Thanks for the Miranda quote.Michael Beers, Ph.D."
Laura Anderson,"Mr. Epstein,The wiseman you refer to is a dope.  The only humans who deliver babies are women.  Even in the case of a cesarean delivery, the bulk of the work has been done. Women carry babies for 9 months.  Their bodies are altered beyond recognition.  Their hearts and  organs work harder to make it happen, all the while preparing their minds for a transformation.  Then, typically,  they PUSH babies out with tremendous strength. Please get the language correct, WOMEN DELIVER BABIES!"
Mort Snerdly,Joe is going to provide us years of laughs with all his gaffes.
James Hare,There was no compelling argument to print this nonsense.
Paul Woehrle,"Mr. Epstein, you owe DR Biden an apologyAnd WSJ, your leadership needs to seriously reconsider the standards of what level of opinion deserves to be printed under your masthead"
Kevin Sorrentino,Oh please 
Fred Mulhauser,"Typical narrow minded elitist pap.  Those who feel threatened often fear a loss of their perceived entitlement, particularly when the ""other"" is a woman.  "
Louis McIntyre,I think we should address her as Prez Biden as she is most likely running the show!
Maureen Oates,"This opinion would NEVER be written about a man in the same way. Jill Biden worked hard for her degree and she has used it in the service of others. The author shows his immaturity and misogyny in it and the WSJ  should choose to focus on matters of substance, not frivolity.  They should also show more respect to a well-educated First Lady. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"How do you know she worked hard?  I have posted below the requirements for an EdD degree from U Delaware.  Not particularly rigorous.  3-4 yrs of night classes and writing a paper?  2.75 GPA and no GRE to get in?This would have amounted to master's degree work, well, before our current days of title inflation.  "
bruce miller,"In rides Ms. DiRienzo with facts to crush the narrative.    And let's not forget that the subject of ""Doctor"" Jill's study was hardly exacting   It is how to ""educate.""   Not exactly a rigorous STEM degree, ne c'est pas?   "
Thomas Erb,"3-4 yrs of night classes is how I got my MSEE, and I didn't got on - that would have taken 3 to 5 years of full time academics. "
Paul Blair,"Could not disagree more and I applaud the chutzpah in light of the inevitable return.  I like Jill Biden, shes an accomplished professional who carries her lunch to work.    I suspect the ""Dr"" moniker arose from one of the cookie cutter JD strategists and expect she will set them straight.   "
Kevin Sorrentino,You must be a NYT subscriber 
Roland Gargani,"Mr. Epstein,do you feel the same about Dr. Martin Luther King?......"
Paul Blair,"I can't answer for Mr Epstein but in my view PhD generally belongs in the trailer.  Sometimes, and MLK was an example ""Doctor"" becomes a ringing moniker denoting great respect but w/o a baby in the house.  "
Kevin Sorrentino,"and Dr. Ben Franklin, and Dr. Maya Angelou.  The latter's was an honorary title   ."
Roland Gargani,and of course Dr.  J   (Julius Erving) 
Kris Thiruvillakkat,"Is there a misogynist in the class room having tough time coping with own inadequacies? Ye, that is Mr. Epstein. Is there a (self declared genius and) narcissist in the White House with similar problems? Yes, that is loser Trump.  Mr. Epstein seems jealous  Dr. Jill Biden's earned qualification (I have many friends with doctorate in education). Too bad for Epstein that the Trump U. is defunct; otherwise , the narcissist Trump would have happily bestowed an ""honorary"" doctorate on Epstein. Question: what is the"" degree"" of separation between a narcissist and a misogynist?"
Kathleen McCook,What about the NEH? That federal agency awarded Epstein the Humanities Medal in 2003?
Knabe Piano,"More than just sexist, this piece panders to an anti-education sentiment. Part of the anti-science theme that Trump started as a way of building populist scorn. The sad part is that lack of critical thinking makes these people pawns in the hands of clever manipulators who wish to impoverish them and take away all their freedoms and rights (except gun ownership)."
Thomas Erb,"an  EdD. is NOT a Phd - and  EdD's  are somewhat to blame for the lack of intellectual rigor in our societyAt the university I attended, the Education department did not give grades. . "
Joseph Painter,"I agree with author.   I have a Ph.D. and a JD and have never allowed anyone to call me ""doctor"".  I reserve that title for the health professions."
STEVEN SILVERMAN,"with the now steady drip of the Biden family ""antics""dropping Dr. is the least of Jills problems"
Mark Killingsworth,"Just goes to show that one can make a fool of one's self not only on Twitter, but also in op-eds for The Wall Street Journal."
ULRICH VISSERING,"The WSJ should apologize for bringing this opinion. Its an insult to a women that earned her title with a dissertation at the university of Delaware and hardly ever meant to disguise, the first ladies life will be a well known open book soon for those who not already know. While people seeing  tv shows might think a ""doctor"" is automatically an M.D., you but also the opinion author should know that this is not the case, that different branches of science, including history, philosophy, arts, education, economy, natural sciences, law, even religious studies  have dissertations and people that have a right to carry their titel with pride. "
STEVEN SILVERMAN,first lady...wanna bet?
ULRICH VISSERING,"..anytime, and a good Flotus she will be. Though I have little reason to argue strongly  against Melania Trump. Its not her job to work against her husband, she found a relatively quiet role at his side and in one regard it was fair to defend her as well as Jill Biden now. In her case because of her former work as photomodel, that brought out some very mysogenist comments regarding some mildly erotic pictures, standard for photo models one might say, but attacked by many in a quite ugly way."
Thomas Lehman,If the wall street journal isn't going to get rid of it's idiotic opinion writers it is soon going to be rid or me!!
chris rasmussen,"Jill is 55, is all I took from this article.  You go Joe!"
Maurice Kirschenbaum,NA
chris rasmussen,"Wow, she looks great for 70.  Not sure why she got an advanced degree at 55, except maybe some teaching pay raise for advanced education."
Patricia Hildebrandt,"I kind of like the Dr tag, it says phony and dishonest louder than anyone could."
kevin mccarthy,Phony and dishonest to have earned an actual doctorate?   
JOSEPH VALENTI,If this is the worse that comes out of the White house we should be grateful.
Nathan Smith,Women deserve better than to have this prompted to your publication. WSJ has  done us all a disservice by giving a platform to someone who belittles accomplishment. 
Brandon Travis,"Mr. Epstein,Addressing Dr. Biden as ""kiddo"" is beyond insulting.As to your content, please find a realistic problem in our country to write about, rather than a personal grudge you have against our a small part of worldwide decorum.  The reason MD's are referred to as ""doctors"" is because in order to practice medicine on your own you have to have a doctorate in it.   I have a doctorate in engineering, and though I never request it people who know that and don't know me personally usually refer to me as ""Dr. Travis"".  "
robert l,"In most of our minds, a doctor is an M.D.  In school, a Ph.D (or D.Ed.) is also a Dr.  For the rest of the world, not knowing what any of these suffixes mean, they shouldn't se the term except to feel self-important.  Hence Dr. Jill is just an epithet."
Joseph Orchardo,"The WSJ opinion/editorial page continues to shame the good work performed by the news division. How do you news writers tolerate working for such  an ignorant editorial board? I can understand it from the TV networks, where a pretty face and rage spittle sells, but it's unbecoming a serious news organization.Does selling advertising (to both halves of the country) mean that much to you(publisher)?  It is the WSJ, so the bottom line being the ultimate goal is not surprising, but the paper is losing credibility (at least among the half that matters). Remember, history is written by the winners, and if the past is at all predictive of the future, I'm confident that the editorial board is on the wrong side.We live in a great country of hard working people who value freedom from tyranny, we will survive this latest (albeit self inflicted) set back to the great experiment of democracy. "
robert l,"Blah, blah, blah.   We are talking about a social climber."
Anton Jones,"Social climber? I firmly believe you are referring to the current occupant of the WH. From a foreign model showing all her private parts, to the first woman of America. Social climber... No one could be a bigger one."
Anton Jones,"Hear , hear"
J Ladine,"Swap thew words "" Doctor Jill Biden"" with  ""Doctor Jerry Falwell"", and change "" Ed.D."" to ""Th.D."" Democrats would then love this sort of opinion piece, complete with sarcasm and disrespect included."
James Coddington,"For those of you who think this is not misogynistic as well as misinformed visit the sentence ""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child."" Currently 85% of Ob-gyn residents are women. So 1) women are medical doctors too but apparently unworthy of the title and by implication degree despite doing the work that Mr. Epstein has reserved for doctors 2) those men and women who have just spent 10 months on the front lines saving the lives of their fellow citizens are equally unworthy 3) those men and women who have just developed the vaccine are unworthy as well. So think about it Mr. Epstein and drop the antebellum ideology and join the world where women accomplish much and are recognized for that. "
Allison Monoey,"Kiddo, really? It's condescending and patronizing in reference to any woman."
Mark Phelan,"""I'm hoping Dr. Jill becomes the surgeon general. She's an amazing doctor."" - Whoopie Goldberg"
ANDREW MACDONALD,Please return Mr. Epstein to the 1950s.  2020 is fully stocked with bloviating old white men.
Alexander De Serna,"I have two degrees but one of them, Juris Doctorate, does not entitle me  to use Dr.  But when in college, I called my professors with PhD or equivalent degrees Doctor because they earned it.   Taking a blind eye to who is now being called Dr.  I would still be inclined to call those with this type degree - Doctor.   Calling Jill Biden - Dr. Jill seems inappropriate, Dr. Biden is the appropriate way of going.   This really is not a partisan issue.   "
J Ladine,"She has an Ed.D., not a Ph.D."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Univ of Delaware offers both PhDs and EdDs in education.  To be accepted into the EdD program you need a minimum 2.75 GPA and no GRE.  Not exactly selective.  You can get the EdD in 3-4 yrs part time.  The PhD takes 4-5 yrs full time.So is Dr Jill inflating her credentials, just a bit?  "
Carolyn Breckel,"How can she be considered inflating her credentials? She received a doctorate and is therefore entitled to the the title of ""Doctor."" She never claimed to be an MD out of Harvard, she never claimed to have a PhD from Yale. But she received the qualification required to be called ""Doctor."" So use it"
Maureen DiRienzo,"But it misleads people.  For example, Whoopi Goldberg told her audience Dr Biden was an incredible doctor and should be made surgeon general.  Would she think Dr Bill Cosby, EdD qualifies too? It is for this reason that those of us with PhDs don't go around expecting everyone to call us 'doctor'.   We know we earned it, we don't need reminding. "
Carolyn Breckel,She is not responsible for the misinformation of others. She is not responsible for others not doing their own research. She deserves the respect due to her and that includes use of her honorific if she so chooses
Maureen DiRienzo,"But she is responsible for her insisting she be referred to as Doctor.  There's a smell of insecurity in that.  Better not to use the title, and have people discover she earned an EdD.  That would be more impressive. "
Carolyn Breckel,"All titles are arbitrary but we collectively use them to denote experience, expertise, and status in some cases. A master craftsman still possesses elite skills even if no one acknowledges it. An individual possessing a doctorate is still an expert in their field even if no one calls them ""doctor."" And the president will still hold that office even if no one addresses him as ""Mr. President.""Using any of these titles connotes a level of respect and there are plenty of arguments to be made about why they shouldn't be used at all. But if our culture insists on using the title Mr. President, insists on referring to master craftsmen accordingly, I don't see any reason why a woman who has earned a terminal degree should not expect the same level of respect.Anyone can choose not to use their title, but if they have asked for it to be used, ignoring it is simply disrespectful--even if you secretly think it's gauche."
bruce miller,We can only pray that Whoopi's next major surgery will be conducted by Dr. Jill.   
George Rosin,"I too have a J.D. and heard a decent case for being permitted to refer to myself as ""Dr.""It was during a contentious deposition of a non-treating physician hired as plaintiff's expert. My boss kept calling him ""Mr. Welby"".  He objected, said he earned the title ""Dr."" Boss asked him if he treated patients. He said ""no"", I do forensic medical examinations.""  Were you paid for the forensic exam?  ""Yes."" Today's testimony?  ""Yes.""  Is this your principle business?  ""Yes"".  That means you are as a businessman, not physician.  So I call you ""Mr.""  Otherwise, you can call me ""Doctor Mason.""   I have the same amount of schooling that you do.I would add that our education more than makes up for not writing or defending a dissertation. For three years non-stop we had to defend every word we spoke or wrote against withering cross-examination by our professors.In any event, Jill  Biden has earned it.  Epstein's problem is with the people who  gave her title, not her."
Zygmunt Dembek,"And so, 3 years of study for a JD degree = 4 years of study for an MD degree (with arguably more rigorous degree entrance requirements) = 5 years of study, research + dissertation for a PhD degree = 3 years p/t study for an EdD degree?"
Paul Orlowski,"I have my Juris Doctorate, and while I may tease that I'm a doctor, the profession utilizes either Esquire for those admitted to a state bar or simply JD at the end of your name for those that are not.  Other professions are not so structured, and I have no problem with someone using the term because they are proud of their hard work."
Maureen DiRienzo,"The Univ of Delaware website provides an explanation of the difference between a PhD in education and an EdD.  The former is a full time, 4-5 yr program.  The EdD is a part time 3-4 yr program.  The former equips one to function in an academic  setting, the latter as an admin in public education.So I think it is clear an EdD is not as rigorous a degree as a PhD.  "
CURT BROWN,I think it is  clear y0u doth protest too much.
James Flood,"Hey Mr. Epstein.  You're kidding, right?  I earned my Ed.D. at age 60, and you better address me as Dr.  Flood .  And get over it."
Michael Welch,Since he has an honorary doctorate  you better call him Dr. Epstein.This is too funny.
Ryan Snyder,"a bit of advice on what may seem like a small but I think is a not unimportant matterI'm still trying to process how THIS is what has been deemed an important topic to take head on.  Maybe this is the start of a return to 'normal' arguments between the right and left?  Is this the moral equivalent of the 'tan suit' outrage from Mr. Obama's presidency.   This is the kind of debate one might have around the dinner table on a Tuesday for fun but certainly is not a concern to be raised on the front pages of the WSJ opinion section.  A plea to the WSJ Editorial Board -- please tell me this was filler.  There's more than enough to unpack from the last four years to field on topics that could shape our country into the future.   There's millions without jobs, a health care system that needs to be improved, political parties have taken too much control and a social media that is raising our children.  Just a sampling."
Gleason Library,"A ridiculous waste of time.What prompted the WSJ to give this man and his archaic opinions a platform?More words by Joseph Epstein from his essay  ""Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity.""They are different front the rest of us.Homosexuals are different, moreover, in a way that cuts deeper than other kinds of human differences-religious, class, racial-in a way that is, somehow, more fundamental.Cursed without clear cause, afflicted without apparent cure, they are an affront to our rationality, living evidence of our despair of ever finding a sensible, an explainable, design to the world.I find I can accept it least of all when I look at my children...But nothing they could ever do would make me sadder than if any of them were to become homosexual. For then I should know them condemned to a state of permanent niggerdom among men, their lives, whatever adjustment they might make to their condition, to be lived out as part of the pain of the earth."""
Sharon Stout,Thank you for sharing more of Joseph Epstein's work.  That quotation is appalling.   
George Rosin,I really would need to read the entire work to make that final judgment. I see strong indications of sarcasm/irony/satire in that quote. I think that might very well be a brutally honest report of the worst case examples of how society viewed homosexuals and the practical problems it created for them and their straight family members. 
Gleason Library,Go ahead and read it - it is horrifying.
Kathleen McCook,Why is this man a holder of the NEH Humanities  Medal? (2003)
Stephen Morris,"After his son had spent many years in study at various academic institutions the old farmer told his friend, I finally figured out what all these academic  titles mean. bswell that's what a male cow leaves in the field, M.S.is more of the same and PhD is simply piled higher and deeper.

Yes, Mr. censor I do want to post this.

Sean Leffers,"Joseph Epstein has a long history of allowing his personal insecurities to be the foundation for attacks on other people. A great place to look if you want your opinions a half-century behind the times, but in his own words, ""pathetic""."
ALAN KAUFMAN,"Any use of Dr. outside of the medical or scientific world is just plain silly. I have a Juris Doctor degree and would cringe at using ""Dr"" before my name. ""Dr' Jill Biden is also silly. Even if her degree weren't some flimsy piece of paper for an essay on community colleges, her use of the term is just a pathetic ego trip by a woman with no scholarly background and who teaches English to community college kids. If she wants to be so pretentious, then Epstein has every right to pretentiously dump on her.I think he is right and even though ""Dr Jill"" is the hook for the story, it sure is time to tell those political science and English majors that they are not ""doctors"" other than in the context of the academic world."
David Kaiser,"There was a high school teacher in our local district who had a JD and insisted on being called ""Doctor _____"" by his students. "
ALAN KAUFMAN,"I don't know a single lawyer who refers to him/her self, or signs documents, as ""Dr."""
Brian Zack,"Wow. Speaking as an M.D., I can only say this is idiocy. ""Doctor"" comes from the Latin for ""teacher."" If you are a doctor, in any field, you have been educated to the point where you can advise or teach others. Whether Ph.D., Ed.D., J.D., Psy.D., or M.D., you have earned the right to be addressed as ""doctor."" Unless Mr. Epstein is truly an ignoramus, I must assume that this piece is in the service of intellectual self-stimulation, for the purpose of getting people to talk about him, rather than to make any serious point. He and the Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of themselves. "
Charles McGill,"I too have an M.D. , and practiced as well as taught residents and medical students. I never used ""Dr"" outside my practice. Socially often people would address me with ""Dr."", which was simply polite for the time, but if they were people I was going to interact with going forward and it had nothing to do with my practice  I would tell them, ""Chuck will do"". Now that I'm retired people may say upon meeting, ""you're a doctor aren't you?"" To which I reply, ""I used to be a doctor"" . I'm sure the author will be pilloried , but hey he can wear the demonization proudly.  Thou shalt not criticize the left, the eleventh commandment. "
JEREMY MONTAGUE,"You can call me ""Doctor,"" or you can call me ""Mister,"" or you can call me ""Professor,"" or you can call me ""Hey Stupid!"" But whatever you do, do NOT call me late for dinner."
Maureen DiRienzo,"From the Washington Times, Mar 8, 2020""
Jill Biden has a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Delaware, and she never lets the American people forget it. Mrs. Biden..insists on being referred to as ""Dr."" Biden. Her Twitter handle is @DrBiden. The press has largely acquiesced: Even though it has persistent trouble referring to actual pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson as ""Dr."" Ben Carson, it is rare indeed to ever see a reference to Jill Biden without ""Dr."" preceding her name.
There's nothing wrong with being proud of one's educational achievements, of course. But Mrs. Biden's unrelenting insistence on being called ""Dr."" sometimes leads to confusion. Just the other day, on ""The View,"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg suggested that Mrs. Biden should be the country's next surgeon general. ""She's a hell of a doctor. She's an amazing doctor,"" Whoopi mused.
Mrs. Biden would likely not be tapped to be surgeon general...But what about Dr Bill Cosby...""Mr Epstein isn't alone in his view"
JERRY STEVLINGSON,"The WSJ is still owned by News Corp., a blatantly right-winged, misogynistic organization and this comes through crystal clear in many of their op/ed pieces (such as this one)."
Claudia Reis,You have to marvel at the complete audacity and arrogance of a white man who ascended to become a college professor without attaining the highest levels of education taking issue with a woman who worked for and achieved that education. What I wonder is why the WSJ would publish such mindless drivel.  
Michael Alvarez,Exactly this. Well said.
Daniel Kielczewski,"Was this op-ed piece worth the effort?  Probably not.  However, it is amusing to see the use of the title.  Personally, I cringe when the Weather Channel uses it when speaking of the on air meteorologists who hold the title.  Sure, they could put PhD next to the name to signify the accomplishment and expertise.  But must they be called ""Doctor"" on the air?   Also, what about lawyers?  They too hold doctorate degrees.  As a matter of fairness and equity, they too should be given the same recognition as Jill Biden, the meteorologists on the Weather Channel, and all those others who are called ""Doctor"" but don't hold a medical degree.   Crazy."
Steven Kretsch,This is a rather childish OpEd for a major daily newspaper. I would hope there are more important issues and more relevant opinions to offer. 
Al Smith,"A totally  unnecessary, mean spirited   and cheep shot at Dr. Biden . For Shame Mr. Epstein."
ROBERT TORCHIA,"Obviously the author is unfamiliar with the rigors of earning a Ph.D. and could never get one himself. Americans should take pride in having an accomplished First Lady who compares quite favorably with the outgoing one. No, she doesn't wear ridiculous dresses with controversial and insensitive scribblings on them, pose for pornographic photographs, and say ""who gives an f about Christmas,"" and build a tennis pavilion in the White House while people are dying of the virus. I guess one has to have a Ph.D. to have that much sense."
Ted Boggs,About what I expect from someone with a B.A. from almost 70 years ago.  Sadly also what I have come to expect from what used to be a high quality opinion section in the WSJ. 
Maureen DiRienzo,"Mr Epstein, with just a lowly BA, has a pretty remarkable CV of scholarly achievements.  You sound like a title snob.  Just like Dr Biden."
Floyd Parks,This qualifies as substance for an opinion in the WSJ.  How far we have fallen
JERRY STEVLINGSON,"Agree.  It has been falling in substance since News Corp. took over Dow Jones in 2007.  Back then, it used to be a pretty balanced (politically) financial paper.  Today, it is just a right-winged mouth piece."
Blanche Christerson,What an utterly condescending article and attitude.  Truly disappointing.
christopher james,"This is click-bait, pure and simple. Just as FOX viewers are migrating to Newsmax, so must the WSJ migrate towards the National Inquirer.  This is the natural devolution of conservative media post Trump.    "
Bing Yang,"I don't think Dr. Biden should drop Dr. because of other people's ignorance. Doctor refers to her academic degree, not medical degree. If people didn't know that, now they do. Maybe they can go ahead and earn a degree of their own."
Maureen DiRienzo," Title inflation is real-When I got my PhD in 1985, there were two prerequisites just to be accepted into the program-- 2, 8 hr days of written exams, 4 questions per day and a stack of blue books where I wrote long answers entirely from memory.  That was followed by a several hour oral exam with 5 professors from various fields who grilled me, tried to trip me up, see what my thinking skills were like on my feet.   There were candidates who were rejected from the PhD program because they couldn't pass this process.   Then after completing 4 yrs of lab research, I had another oral exam with 5 profs who challenged my work, seeing how capable I was to defend it.  Today, there is no prelim oral exam and the written exam is take home, so of course, references can be used.  Are PhDs easier to get now?  Well, it is certainly easier to get into a program now.  And no, I never use my Dr title.  It would feel pompous.  "
CURT BROWN,I was trying to figure out the point of your post in the context of Jill Biden.  But then I realized it really doesn't matter much.
Carolyn Breckel,"There are indeed still several-hours-long preliminary oral qualifying exams, Maureen-speaking from experience!"
William Gaggos,"We pay way too much homage to education credentials, and we don't listen closely enough to those who don't have them. Mr. Epstein obviously had to prove himself with his own wit, reasoning and logic, and the fact he did it without the credentials so many people covet should be applauded.  "
Maureen DiRienzo,"At one time the world's expert on Shakespeare was a professor at Harvard. But he only had a Master's degree.  His PhD fellow professors tried to urge his to go for the big title.  His reply,""Under whom would I study?""  "
George Raymond,Didn't the MD degree begin in barber shops???? Get a haircut and be bled at the same time.
Charles McGill,"there you go. In the UK surgeons are called ""Mr"" and will correct you if you address them as ""Doctor"". Fun to see the libs get their knickers in a knot over this business. "
CURT BROWN,The person in a knot is the author of the article.I think it's fun when someone takes pains to comment on  how other posters are wound up. As if  that person isn't.
Elise Langan,"Poseur, heal thyself. "
Jean Johnson,"Many voters do not look closely at a candidate's spouse. Some people will have voted believing that Jill Biden is a medical doctor ... and that therefore there will be a medical doctor at Joe Biden's side at all hours. This would be a reassuring factor for those worried about his mental competence -- that is, everyone. So, yes, the campaign allowed this confusion (er, misinterpretation) to stand.  So, yes, her use of the title Doctor throughout a presidential campaign was deceptive. And the media let it pass."
CURT BROWN,"""Some people will have voted believing that Jill Biden is a medical doctor""ROFL. Yeah, probably about 11 people. The WSJ should run a new poll. ""Did you vote for Joe Biden because you thought his wife was a physician?""The ones who answer ""yes"" probably won't know what the word ""physician"" means."
Jean Johnson,"Whoopi Goldberg believed it, right on national TV."
CURT BROWN,"OK, 12 people."
Al Smith,Anyone giving credit to Whoopi Goldberg should have their head examined by a DR of psychiatry 
CURT BROWN,I think  I'd take medical advice from Dr. Jill Biden before taking it from Dr. Scott Atlas.
Wayne Ryback,"You are a true follower of ""Science."""
CURT BROWN,"Scott Atlas sure isn't.But then, of course, that's why Trump appointed him."
Wayne Ryback,I knew you'd take the bait.
CURT BROWN,"I knew y0u would, too.(Stop trying to punch above your weight class. You're simply not that clever.)"
Wayne Ryback,Now yoy're down to cheap insults. How typical!
CURT BROWN,"Just telling the  truth -- which to a Trump  person is an ""insult."""
Charles McGill, Atlas's training required a good deal more intellectual horsepower than a certain Jill who came down the hill. You have a nice day there in the echo chamber. 
Sara Baker,I'm shocked at the comments below.  Who knew there were so many fainting hearts that are outraged at this piece that it doesn't give due homage to a doctorate of edjumacation.  I found the piece well done.  I'm female from birth and it doesn't bother me.  I guess I'm on my way to be canceled. 
CURT BROWN,Y0u're not that important.
Sara Baker,Why thank you Curt!  I guess we can be not that important together. 
CURT BROWN,"I never said I  was, at least not so important as to believe I might be ""canceled.""Continue with your delusions of grandeur. It somehow suits you."
Sara Baker,Merry Christmas Curt.  May this season being you the peace so desperately needed in this plague year.  PS and thanks again for the kind words. 
CURT BROWN,"Merry Christmas to you, too. Thanks for alerting all of us to  the witty and  creative ""edjumacation."" I plan on using it a lot in the New year to appear similarly witty and creative."
Timothy Martin,"If someone says they're a doctor, do you next think ""medical or PhD?""  "
CURT BROWN,"IME, someone who holds a doctorate never says, ""I'm a doctor,"" so it's moot question. There's a difference between the noun and the title. Most people know that."
Wayne Ryback,"Your experience certainly doesn't include a lot of people I have met. Or maybe you meant ""IMO."""
CURT BROWN,"Really? So when you asked those people what  they do for a living, they said, ""I'm a doctor""? In what context did they proclaim that? Or did they just walk up to you, unsolicited, and say it?"
Wayne Ryback,"Sorry, Curt, but you just tried to change your original statement. That's called sophistry, and is a weak substitute for argument."
CURT BROWN,"Sorry, Wayne. Y0u  obviously stepped in it and can't figure out how to  get y0ur foot loose.Nice try, however."
Gail H. Brown,Pathetic that Mr. Epstein would write this editorial and that WSJ would publish it.
John Diamond,"Let me get this straight...  A guy with a bachelor of arts degree is publicly lecturing those who have earned a terminal degree in their fields, minimizing them with an ad hominem smear ('they're just bush league') and much space devoted to a shocking, irrelevant revelation that unearned (honorary) degrees might not carry the same weight.  And the guy has one of those unearned degrees that he appears to deride.  He doesn't give the date he got it, and I'm not going to bother to look him up, but it must have been between the late '50s and January 2007, when the standards went to hell and Dr. B. earned her doctorate.  And I'm sure that the mention of Dr. B's age was in respect of those of us who return to school for advanced degrees past our late 20s.The author displays his intellectual horsepower with impressive non-sequiturs and calls to authority, along with a novel approach to time and/or math, in which January 2007 is 15 years from December 2020.Good to see standards at the WSJ."
Scott Blackburn,Someone needs to get a life and it's NOT Dr. Jill Biden.  Another misogynistic comment to undermine Women.  
Wayne Ryback,"Where in this article does Epstein specifically address women who hold PhDs? A poser is a poser, regardless of sex."
tom toale,"Just FYI it would be helpful if you allowed me to unsubscribe on line now rather than requiring me to wait until your customer service line opens tomorrow. My subscription will have been essentially free, but based on this article even having a free subscription to the WSJ is somewhat like being offered a free Proud Boys tee shirt. No thank you. "
Sara Baker,"Who is this Epstein guy kidding.  Dr of edjumacation  Jill INSISTS on the title and the supine press has more than accommodated her insistence. And of course, if the fat lady sings, she'll be the top union teacher in the land in the WH.  Won't that be grand? The unions won't have to actually do anything but walk in the front door and out the back with whatever largesse they can get their hands on. The kids?  Lip service and those promises?  Yeah yeah, maybe next year. "
Claudina Veas,Once a gain I'm tempted to cancel this subscription. 
Shelley Sims,"Oh sweetie, obviously you have issues...with women? With people more educated than you? Does it even matter? Regardless, you might want to  rethink your life choices. Maybe your editor wants to rethink some things too. "
T Ottis,Egads!  What a Dino this guy is.  Stunning ignorance on full display
Martha lockhart,"I'd say Mr. Epstein is jealous since he only has an ""honorary"" doctorate.   And Mr. Nussbaum, a doctorate EARNED is not credential inflation.  It is a credential."
Sara Baker,"A doctorate in edjumacation is nothing more than a credential. The ""education"" curriculum is a farce.  Always has been. "
CURT BROWN,"That ""edjumacation"" thing is witty and original. Y0u must have a doctorate in creative writing."
Wayne Ryback,Envy doesn't become you.
Sara Baker,"Why thank you Curt!  No, I don't have a degree in creative writing.  I do have a degree and an advanced one at that.  But I don't wear those on my forehead for the world to see.And most people know that the education curriculum is dreadfully simple.  Subject matter isn't relevant to the degree, which is a shame. Remember the old adage?  Those that can't do, teach?  It's as simple as that.But thanks again for your kind words. Merry Christmas. "
CURT BROWN,"""And most people know that the education curriculum is dreadfully simple.""Ah, yes. The ""most people know"" tactic. One thing I  like about Trumpers. They're consistent."
David Purdy,"Master Epstein sounds like He's auditioning for the part of Uncle Fester in a reboot of Addams Family Values. But seriously, this may be the most ignorant opinion piece I've ever read anywhere. "
Richard Bakalars,"Whoopie Goldberg said Dr. Biden would make a great Surgeon General.  One of the smartest things Whoopie or anyone on ""The View"" has ever said."
JOSEPH WERSTAK,I think we have more things to worry about with the Biden administration and their socialist segment . This is the least of them. She seems like a very nice smart lady and she earned her doctorate so no big deal.
Joe Nussbaum,"Credential inflation really is a problem in our society.  It puts more barriers between the haves and have-nots, even though they are often times fake barriers.  You'd think that liberals would recognize this and work to oppose it, but they are the worst offenders.  That's probably because liberals dominate academia,  and their livelihood depends on it."
Rod Mcleod,"@Mr. Epstein - Really? Your ""scholarship-envy"" is showing.  Just because your educational ambitions were obviously limited doesn't mean that those who took a higher and more ambitious path shouldn't declare their success.P.S. I wonder how Dr. Henry Kissinger feels about your critique!P.P.S. @WSJ Editorial Board - Wow! Your pettiness is an embarrassment to your readers."
Dwayne Borgstrand,"No matter how ""diluted"" the requirements according to  Epstein, BA, the achievement of any accredited,  earned doctoral degree today is a considerable accomplishment and should be afforded the common courtesy of the title ""doctor.""  Somehow I think the American public is sophisticated enough differentiate the different degrees from a MD."
Dan C,"Mr. Epstein  seems to have hit a nerve based on all the MSM criticism  he is getting.    They  select quote him by saying he called her 'kiddo', ignoring the full quote and the context.     Good job Mr.  Epstein!"
Jean Johnson,"I see nothing misogynistic in Mr. Epstein's criticism.  Northwestern is being ridiculous. It's always fair to call out frauds or semi-frauds, of men or of women. In fact, it's helpful."
Martha lockhart,Are you possibly saying that Dr. Biden's doctorate is fraudulent?
Claudina Veas,"And where is the fraud in Dr. Biden's degree? If you don't see anything misogynistic in Mr. Epstein opinion, look at yourself in the mirrow."
Jean Johnson,Misogynistic means hateful of women.  Mr. Epstein's comments would be the same  if Mr. Biden's spouse were Mr. Buttigieg.
Jean Johnson,Misogynistic means hateful to women. Mr. Epstein's comments would still be valid if Mr. Biden's spouse were Mr. Buttigieg.
Hui Yuan, Is WSJ hacked or shall I cancel my subscription?  what a garbage opinion. 
George Raymond,"And now he has been ""canceled"" by the potentates and mandarins of high intelligence at Northwestern. Which proves beyond doubt that one can be educated far beyond their intellect. Our fair land will never be united again."
Shelley Strohm,"A little degree envy, there Mr. Epstein?   The man with the Bachelor's just a little unhappy with the women with the Doctor's?   What else explains the snarky attack?  The belittling, snide comments?You are just going to have to live with it, kiddo (even though it hurts)"
ENID HINKES,The author of this opinion piece is now persona non grata at Northwestern University for writing it.  He has been accused of being misogynist for daring to criticize  a female Democrat. 
EA yke,Good. It's 2020. He addressed our First Lady as kiddo.....
kim masters,"A doctorate degree entitles a person to the title Dr. that is what it means. Even in nursing. Doctor means teacher, that t is all"
J Ladine,"I have known many people who earned an Ed.D. or Ph.D. or Th.D.  All of them were good people.None of them went by ""Doctor"" or asked anyone to call them ""Doctor"" in any social or professional settings.    EVER.  Most of them would gently correct anyone who called them ""Doctor"".Part of what makes them good people was that they are authentic, humble, and sincere, and they don't want to create confusion.  Being Educated, they know that the language and the culture reserves ""Doctor"" for somebody who completed medical school, internship, and residency--studying and perfecting medicine until the age of 30 or 35 if there are multiple specialties involved.The scorn poured out by comments below is what people do when they get caught stealing respect that isn't fully deserved.  It is pearl clutching.  It is feather licking.  It is flock squawking.  The complainers are just as insincere as people who exaggerate their academic credentials."
George Rosin,"You must be kidding. How has Jill Biden (Dr. Jille Biden) exaggerated her academic credentials? She has  PhD from an accredited program. Period. End of story, ""Dr."" Jill Biden is a completely legitmate and wholly accurate representation of her academic credentials. That's what the Degree means for crying out loud.You and Epstein have bootstrapped your own standards for earning the degree. It's nonsense. Judging from his essay, it seems to me that Epstein is suffering from ""degree envy."""
Martha lockhart,"I suppose it depends on what culture you live in.  The culture I live in understands that a doctorate is a doctorate, and the term doctor is not limited to medical doctors."
Sharon Stout,"""The scorn poured out by comments below is what people do when they get caught stealing respect that isn't fully deserved.  It is pearl clutching.  It is feather licking.  It is flock squawking.""   Scorn?  As in this comment?  ""I have known many people who earned an Ed.D. or Ph.D. or Th.D.  All of them were good people.""   So, you haven't.  And you aren't.   Is that what you're saying?  "
J Ladine,"I am significantly past a doctoral degree.  I don't let people call me ""Doctor""."
Sharon Stout,"""I am significantly past a doctoral degree. ""   And that means - what, exactly?   ""I don't let people call me 'Doctor'.""  Bully for you.    But what does that have to do with Dr. Biden?   "
A. Coe,"Joe Epstein is one of the last gasps of a dying breed. And like other aging members of his class and gender, he will take up as much space and air as possible before he's kicked off the stage."
John Tranchitella,I just have one thing to say: Joseph who? 
pete Phillips,"I feel this piece is simply""emotainment."" Outrageous and shocking so readers can focus on it while important news goes unread. Classic Murdoch.  Yawn. "
Doug Gross,"WSJ routinely quotes and displays the ""Dr."" title in front of Assistant Marketing professors, and other business instructors, (as displayed in the Search results). If someone has earned a PhD from an accredited university, their title should be included. Dr. Jill Biden served as Second First Lady for 8 years, and will soon be the First Lady. Please stick to the facts. - Sabrina Gross"
Tag Goulet,"After reading this nonsense, I am reconsidering my decision to subscribe to the WSJ. Why would you give a platform to this man for this purpose? This is not the type of  ""journalism"" that I want to support."
Rosemary Bray McNatt,"Joseph Epstein has spent decades impersonating a learned man when, in fact, he has simply regurgitated the prejudices of his race and gender.  These eruptions have been tiresome for some years, but this recent whine in the Wall Street Journal is especially offensive.  Dr. Biden earned her degree;  he, on the other hand, was too lazy or self-satisfied to pursue further study.  Why should she listen to you?  Indeed, why should any of us?  I invite Mr. Epstein to take all the seats.  (Feel free to look that up.)"
Julie Westermann,This seems more about Mr. Epstein justifying his lack of degrees. Meow!
robert schmidt,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.""Dear men, none of you have ever delivered a child, not really (with apologies to a few trans men), but go ahead and call yourself doctor, sweetpea. "
Jennifer Sheets,I'm glad I canceled my subscription last weekend.
J Ladine,What a great comment to make as your first comment ever on WSJ.Yes...trial subscriptions always come to an end. 
Sharon Stout,"""What a great comment to make as your first comment ever on WSJ.
Yes...trial subscriptions always come to an end.""  Actually, it takes effort to cancel a WSJ subscription.   I cancelled mine about a week ago and had to spend 25 minutes on hold and talk to two people to get them to stop charging my credit card.   Sad that the WSJ is desperate for subscribers, and still publishes tripe like this.  "
EA yke,Paid for it this year but won't be paying for it again. I've had enough.
Anton Jones,Me as well. WSJ has become an embarrassment. 
Leroy Plock,"What a jerk. You're equating your honorary doctorate with her earned doctorate. Why is this article necessary? What purpose does it serve other than to denigrate Dr. Biden? WSJ, please protect your reputation and don't let your editorial page become a forum for frat boy personal grievances like that other Murdoch owned media company."
Lisa Gallagher,"WSJ your approval of the condescending sexist piece now raises the question whether you want female readers?Mr Epstein appears to have pathological envy for those who completed a doctorate and women in particular - and spent quite a bit of time venting his petty minded spleen. Those who can, do good deeds like Dr. Jill Biden. Those who can't apparently spend time on an Op Ed that shows how much he wishes he had the honorific, but never did the work."
Sharon Stout,"""WSJ your approval of the condescending sexist piece now raises the question whether you want female readers?""   I think the answer is no.  But that is the WSJ Editorial Board which seems lost in the presidential transition -- while the WSJ loses readers to OANN, NewsMax, etc. and also those of us who are giving up.   "
Sarah White,"Disgusting article. Shame on the WSJ for permitting such a garbage opinion piece. It is simply insulting!Furthermore, the term ""Dr."" was first used to describe one who had earned a PhD before it came to be associated with MDs. Joseph-I hope the WSJ gives you a chance to apologize to Jill and the world for this insidious article. Shame on you for demonizing her education!"
Richard Newsome,This is a very long piece from someone with delusions of adequacy. 
Mandy OBrien,Sounds like he's just upset that her diploma is bigger than his.
Jennifer Murray,"PURE DISRESPECTFUL DRIVEL...... signed, a staunch Conservative. How did the WSJ publish something so blatantly patronizing? This writer is a daft idiot. Editor should be fired for even entertaining the notion of publishing this, let alone actually giving this voice a platform. "
Robert Wade,"""The Ph.D. may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards....""  Goodness, Mr. Epstein--I thought  you were segueing to a comparison with the current degradation of standards within the Republican Party.  "
Tyler Mahaffey,as a subscribing member i am completely disgusted with this article and absolutely shocked that it was published. 
EA yke,Agreed.
robert schmidt,Why on earth did the WSJ publish this? The author literally calls Dr. Biden 'kiddo' in the first sentence.
Dan C,Read it in context.
David Padilla-Garza,This article is full of ignorance and prejudices. I hold a PhD myself. I graduated this year from the Courant Institute. I had to sacrifice 5 years of my life in order to get this degree. These were 5 years of arduous effort and determination. It is clear to anyone who knows anything that standards for graduating are much higher today than they were decades ago. Any dissertation written today would make a dissertation written 50 years ago look like a class project.  Your lack of respect for this kind of sacrifice and achievement is insulting and ignorant. You have convinced me of only one thing: you should not call yourself a writer. 
Masood Mortazavi,"A PhD is certainly not a requirement for success. However, that does not mean that those who earn one have done nothing. It also does not mean that the title of any dissertation (say, even ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs"") needs to promise anything.Scholars rarely write for the general public. If anything, unpromising titles are often purposefully selected as a sign of modesty. 

I'm not saying anything about the quality of Dr. Jill Biden's dissertation. 
Many PhD dissertations are simply a point in a journey.
What matters is the whole life and thought of a given scholar and how they influence others around them.To denigrate someone who has put away years of her life into research that went into her dissertation is simply quite childish. I don't understand why the WSJ would provide the soapbox for such a personal vendetta. What was the agenda behind it?"
EA yke,The agenda was to normalize disrespect towards a very respectable person.
Theodore Wong,Well that's a few minutes of my life I'll never get back
Jim Holmberg,It could be worse.  You could be listening to a Biden speech.
Timothy Devinney,"The US is exceptional on this.  It is perhaps the only country where MD, confers the title Dr. in common parlance.  In Australia and the UK,  ""Professor"" is only used for those of the rank of Professor whereas in the US your dog would be called Professor if they were teaching at a university.  Lecturers (Asst Profs), Snr Lecturers (Assoc Profs) are all referred to as Dr.  In Germany, the Dr. degree is lower than a Professor where one usually has to do a Habilitation to get the title Professor.  So you find all sorts of people in the corporate world sporting the title Dr.  It is official and part of your name.   Usually ""Professors"" in German Univ hold the designation Prof. Dr. indicating that they have both the doctorate and the habilitation.  Again, it is an official designation. But woe is the person misusing the title as states have a law agains ""abuse of an academic title"".  Perhaps Congress needs to move quickly on this important national issue and get that law passed quickly. "
LESLIE KELLER,"The title ""Doctor"" did not refer to medicine until medicine actually became a scientific endeavor fairly recently in human history. It started with medieval universities and was mostly based on learning in theology, I believe. Mr. Epstein seems to not know his history when he says it ""wise"" to think that only medical doctors (that have delivered babies at least once for some reason?) should use that title."
Victor Gilinsky,"The Dr. title belongs in a professional setting, not in the wider world. But the Journal never questioned it when Jim Schlesinger was Defense Secretary and always used it. And Dr is a lot more acceptable in a republic than First Lady, which is the stupidest title of all., reflecting a childish wish to have a king and queen."
Martha lockhart,And certainly no one chided Dr. Henry Kissinger for his doctorate.
Chris Stevenson,"Mr Epstein sounds like a cranky old man.  Perhaps he should have kept this opinion to himself and the Editors of the WSJ I am sure can find better, more thoughtful opinions to grace their sacred pages.   "
Sarah White,"Cranky, old, and spectacularly uneducated!"
Diane Sacchetti,And a mentality about women stuck in the 1950's. 
Sharon Wang,"Another insightful and witty essay, Mr. Epstein.  Thank you!  One main reason I subscribe to the WSJ. "
miles derhund,"It was neither insightful or witty, kiddo."
John Doyle,I am furious. This is disgusting. How in the world can the editors allow something like this as an opinion piece??
LILBURN T,You have to wonder what went through the Editorial Page editors' minds when they actually decided to include this among their opinion pieces.  it'sa stunning miscalculation that is now drawing a remarkable degree of attention to the Wall Street Journal's opinion editors' lack of judgment.  Do they really despise the Bidens so much that they thought Mr Epstein's silly screed would resonate with their readership?  Do you think Rupert Murdoch would approve of it? I doubt it; I suspect (and hope) that somebody is squirming at News Corp tonight.
Michael Bowman,"I recently engaged a discussion with readers of the Washington Post about the Bidens. I called to question how Joe Biden has three nice houses on a career of government salaries. Seems to me more likely that his brother James and, more recently son Hunter, have been laundering the money to Joe with their ""plausible deniability"" schemes. One Biden defender reflexively replied that Joe's wife is a doctor. So of course they have a lot of money because doctors tend to make a lot of money. The commenter apparently thought Jill Biden has had a long career as a medical doctor. "
Elizabeth Hughes,"Three?  I thought it was two.  The first was built after purchasing property in 1996.  And wasn't  the second one purchased in 2017 after he struck a $10 million book deal and his wife a $3 million book deal?  Plus he and his wife made about $5 million on speaking engagements from 2017-2019.  Biden has released his tax returns, it should be easy to trace source of the money."
John Tranchitella,Why  don't you Mr Bowman ask the same questions about Mitch McConnell or better yet Donald Trump? We have seen the Biden's tax returns. 
Shelley Strohm,"Michael, you need to do some research and get your facts straight.  Biden bought low and sold high.  He has been investing in real estate for years.By the way, why is it that the right wing always thinks making money is a sign of intelligence if the person is on the right but a sign of a crime if the person is on the left?    Just another case of the right wing being hypocrites. "
Linda Garboczi,Is the author 100 years old? Hang up the pen Mister. Your perspective is so off-base and so very privileged. Wall Street Journal you should be ashamed of printing this garbage. Subscription canceled.
Kathleen Krauss,"I read the WSJ opinion page to have my opinions challenged and my horizons expanded. This piece did neither. It was sloppily constructed and never really got to the point. The author is bothered by a First Lady using an earned academic honorific. He couldn't come up with an actual reason to be bothered by this, so he blathered on about unrelated issues he had with higher ed. The only question I was left with was this: who cares?Where was the editing team on this? How does this stuff get out the door?"
Robert Novick,"   The author's egotistical view of himself as he denigrates Dr. Biden's accomplishments is outrageous, pretentious  and sexist. He also has his facts wrong. Yes, Bill Cosby is undoubtedly a sex offender.  However, Dr. Bill Cosby's degree is not honorary. He actually earned his doctorate at the prestigious University of Massachusetts School of Education, Amherst Campus in 1976. He did his own research, compiled his and analyzed his statistics and defended his dissertation like other doctoral candidates. I know this for a fact because my father-in-law was his classmate."
kane marlow,"I agree, it""s use is based on the ego boost it gives her.As Dr. Epstein stated, a doctorate is worth much less not when it's given out by online diploma mills like the University Of Phoenix or Capella University."
Kathleen Krauss,Neither of which are the institution that granted Dr. Biden's degree. I don't see the point here.
John Sabini,"""Madame First Lady-Mrs. Biden-Jill-kiddo""?? Mr Epstein kiddo, #babe, sweetie.  It is a bit appalling to use this language.  Did you address the former First Lady in this manner? Low class, low class."
Constance Mencer,"The responses by so many commenters to this article border on hysteria, especially those of new readers who are canceling their subscriptions. Seriously? I hope they were similarly upset about some of the media's treatment of Melania or Amy Comey Barrett.As a former academic, Epstein has the  credibility to opine about the devaluation of many college degrees. He compares examples of the ""old school"" PhD grind to his own experiences of conducting friendly PhD examinations. He says there's a difference in the two eras and I don't doubt it. Maybe someone here will refute Epstein based on their own academic life. But he's still walked the walk. As for Jill Biden, the use of ""Dr"" by academics produces opinions pro and con.  Many suggest the holder of a PhD be referred to as Dr only in an academic or professional setting like a conference. It sounds pretentious to me if Biden insists on the title, but it's her call and I won't cancel my subscription either way. John Mencer "
Jesse Nemoyer,"Epstein didn't do the grind, he watched it.Easy to tell, as he doesn't even touch on the years of rice and beans living in poverty covering over-populated classes regular faculty deemed beneath them for a graduate teaching assistantship that barely covered tuition earned through cut-throat competition ... before you could even get to the languages, and quals, and oral exams, and dissertations ... oh, and he left out the grant apps, too.No, it's not his experience.My students don't need to call me Dr., or even professor, but they generally do, because I respect them, and they respond by returning it, a lesson Dr. Epstein might want to learn before trying again to deny respect to others."
junzhe zou,WSJ why would you even publish this piece of low grade human waste level of jumble of words? This piece disappoints me. It serves no legitimate purposes besides letting a honorary doctor feel good about himself. 
Jon Austin,"I'm not sure why the author feels the need to denigrate Dr. Biden's accomplishments, the use of the honorific she's clearly earned or the topic of her dissertation, but the condescension comes through loud and clear along with some not-so-subtle credentialing of his own. Similarly, I'm not sure why the opinions editor of the Journal thought this merited publication. Surely, there are more important topics and useful perspectives to kill trees and fire electrons in order to share."
Paul Conklin,"My father, with his PhD in physics, was universally referred to as Dr. Conklin throughout his college teach career, which largely overlaps that of Mr. Epstein.  He was not considered a fraud our a comic. If Mr. Epstein feels it is a fraud for Dr. Biden to claim the same title, then the only thing he is demonstrating is that he should retire from public commentary in the 21st century."
George Gibson,"How did this piece get published? Strangely enough I don't blame the writer, lots of  poorly reasoned stuff gets written. Your editorial staff, however, needs some serious help. Stop besmirching the reputation of a publication with a stellar news organization with this sort of drivel."
Claire Gordon,"How dare you refer to an adult woman as ""kiddo"". WSJ editors, what the hell were you thinking? Leaving aside the pathetic ramblings of a clearly envious man which never should have been published, how did you let that bit of condescension get past you? Seriously. This paper is declining rapidly. "
DONALD THORNE,"Sorry.  This is ridiculous.  If someone goes through the effort get obtain a PhD, then they have the title Dr.  If you don't like the system, then change the system.  Don't criticize someone's hard work when you haven't done the same.  You are proud enough to mention your  B.A.  Should we suggest that people can't reference their B.A on their resume now?"
Samuel Contreras,"Dr. Joseph Epstein's column is absolute garbage and below the standards of the WSJ. It would be a ""touch comic"", if it wasn't so embarrassing. "
TJ Jackson,"Things that actually are ""fraudulent"":

1) Plagiarizing your predecessor's speech; 2) Completing less than two semesters of college, but listing a degree in your bio; and 3) Claiming you're fluent in French & Italian, yet being unable to say more than a few simple phrases in them when you meet native speakers.So where was this energy and contempt four years ago?"
Gene McKenna,"I think you can read as far as the word ""kiddo"",  (7 words into this) and see what the real agenda is here. If he had a point to make about use of the title Dr for someone with a PhD, he could have just made that point. Why single out Jill Biden? Is he afraid of her? "
Tom Merle,"Had the wife of Mr. Biden been a male I have no doubt he would have referred to him with something like ""buddy boy"".  This is not a sexist piece.  Sex is irrelevant to the gist of Mr. Epstein's essay."
Martha lockhart,This  piece would never have been written about a man.
Joseph Canepa,My nomination for the worst article ever published in the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ should sack Epstein and all the editors that approved such a stupid senseless article. 
Ryan Guerra,"This is one of the most disgraceful articles I have ever read. Diminishing a defended, earned doctoral dissertation simply because one doesn't understand the title or content is petty and reeks of envy and no small amount of chauvinism.
 A doctorate degree is painstakingly earned by the discovery and dissemination of original knowledge for all of human kind. Regardless of the merit of an honorary doctorate, it is inconceivable to me that the author would try to equate Dr. Biden's earned degree to an honorary doctorate as if they were comparable simply because the titles are similar.
 I'm disappointed that the author's opinion, which so inelegantly presents flawed argument, false equivalencies, insulting rhetoric, and irrelevant anecdote, was considered of high enough quality to be published in these pages.In my opinion Dr. Biden should lead with the earned title and end with the secondary title bestowed by circumstance: ""Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady."""
Michael Graban,"I think the accomplishment of getting a PhD deserves recognition; however, I've known a number of PhD's and there are a few whose egos get  ahead of their accomplishments, and as a result they demand being called doctor.  For most humans, the title of doctor is reserved for those in the medical profession;  otherwise, I find it sad to demand to be called doctor."
John Sabini,Dr. Kissinger had no problem with insisting that he be called doctor.  
Tom Merle,A PhD might deserve recognition but a EdD might not.
Tommy Butler,"Our Founding Fathers looked down upon self-aggrandizing titles.That is precisely why Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution directs that:""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States""."
David Sims,"No title of educational or professional knowledge or attainment is a title of nobility.  No PhD is claiming to be King.It is, however, a title of distinction that helps those in need of a particular body of knowledge or skill set to find a person with suitable knowledge and/or skills for a given undertaking."
Kate Cannon,"Excuse me? Apparently, you don't  know the difference between the nobility and people with advanced degrees. Titles of nobility are inherited, not earned. A Ph.D. is conferred by a university on students who have fulfilled the requirements of a  graduate program, produced original research in the form of a dissertation,  and have met the scholarly standards of peer review by their dissertation advisors. Those who have completed their doctorate are given the title ""Doctor of Philosophy"" or Ph.D.  "
Tamara Babic,"what about our founding mothers, did they also scoff at such things?   your post is about as pathetic and ridiculous as the original op.ed. piece.  i  am struggling to comprehend why WSJ even printed such garbage in the first place.  reputation means so much to and a piece like this goes a long way towards damaging it.  i have been a subscriber for years, perhaps the time has come to reconsider."
V KARLSON,Well said!  The preening and pretentiousness is ridiculous. 
Christina Rodriguez MBA,You think? I just added my degree designation (MBA) to my name in solidarity. 
David Hsu,"You don't need to call Jill Biden a doctor, but calling her a ""kiddo""?"
Kathi Jackson,"I just recently subscribed to digital access to WSJ, for the primary purpose of gaining access to the interesting articles on issues related to health and society. I'm going to cancel my subscription as a result of this pathetic and embarrassing essay. It reads like something that one would expect from a small-town newspaper."
Tom Merle,Talk about cutting off your nose...
Juan Diaz,"Very disgusting editorial.  Have you no shame,  Mr. Epstein?  In education, earning a doctorate is highly prized and respected.  I remember Secretary of State Henry Kissinger being called Dr. Kissinger.   He had a PhD in Political Science from Harvard.   No one ever called him Mr. Kissinger.  It was always Dr. Kissinger.   Jill Biden is a great educator and loves the teaching profession and plans to continue teaching while also serving as First Lady.   She has never held herself out to be an MD.   I have never been confused by her title.  You should show more respect for her as an educator,  a woman, and our next First Lady.  "
V KARLSON,Clearly he disagrees with your assessment regarding the earning of a doctorate.  That's the point of opinion pieces...they're an opinion. Just because it isn't yours doesn't make it wrong. 
Olga Penina,"to WSJ: - thank you for (still) letting people have opinionsto Mr Epstein : just ordered your bookto the haters: you are all the same and really boringto everybody else: the for-profit education is a real problem,xoxoxo"
Leon Granowitz,"A Ph.D or any doctorate requires expertise in some subject. The prerequisites to be president  according to Article II of the U.S. Constitution, is that the person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years. The prerequisites for a dog catcher or to pass the citizenship test are must more stringent than to be the president of the USA.  Even an orangutan can be president if enough fools vote for it. Hmm, there's something familiar about that."
Samuel Contreras,Plot twist: an orange orangutang did become president. He's now throwing tantrums in the Oval Office trying to steal the election. 
M ODonnell,"I could imagine Mr. Epstein, if he were challenged, trying to scrounge up some clever, innocuous-sounding rationalization for any of the gratuitous insults and slights in this article, but what could he possibly have to say if asked to explain why he saw fit to use the word ""kiddo"" to address a 69-year-old professional woman he apparently has never even met?As for this gem:Political correctness has put paid to any true honor an honorary doctorate may once have possessed. If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try ""rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.""I guess ""political correctness"" is the only explanation you can fathom for why a black woman might be honored by an institution of higher education, right, Joe?Wall Street Journal editors, do yourselves a favor and ditch this ignorant bag of dust."
Sarah Contomichalos,This is a ridiculous editorial and well below the WSJ's usual standards.  Would Seth Meyers make the same argument about Dr. Henry Kissinger or Dr. Zbigniew Brezinski or is it just women who are not entitled to use the title unless they have been to medical school?
J Badger,Seth Meyers didn't write this opinion piece.
Andrew Sachs,"Shame on the WSJ.  After more than 30 years I just canceled my subscription.  If you need to ask why, then you have already missed the point.  "
Auritte Ross,"Some men have the chutzpa to tell women how to conduct themselves.   Just because Dr. Biden  didn't dissect cadavers, it doesn't mean she didn't work just as hard academically.  Mr. Epstein, you are  now 87 years old. Maybe it's time for you to realize that the world has moved on.  "
Sarit Polevoy,Your column was patronising and cheap. I'm not such a huge fan of the Bidens but this column makes you sound like you are still campaigning for Trump. The subject of easily acquired PhD's can and should be addressed without the future First Lady in it
Leon Granowitz,"Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D. Indeed, Trump's physician is not an MD!"
Craig Dawkins,"This op-ed is shallow and beneath what I thought the journalistic standards were at WSJ. I'm reevaluating my opinion on that matter. This is nothing but a cheap, shallow, and discrediting op-ed, not to subject of the op-ed, but to the author and to the credibility of the WSJ. Aren't you better than this?  "
J Badger,"No, the opinion section hasn't been better than this for a long time now."
W Kroll,"Was this meant for FOX News and then got mixed up and wound up here? This is low level stuff that should have never made it to the site or paper. I'm all about a dissention of opinion, in fact I think it's healthy and necessary. But to be a jerk just for the sake of being a jerk is a whole different ballgame.  The WSJ should issue an apology for their obvious error in greenlighting this petty opinion piece. "
Samuel Contreras,Agreed. 
Saranna Thornton,"Would be great if WSJ op-ed writers did their homework.  A doctorate in education (Ed.D.) is an *earned* doctorate.  Retention at the community college level is an important issues.  Epstein shows his ignorance by suggesting no one should adopt the title ""doctor"" unless they have delivered a child.   Dr. Jill Biden has delivered a child.  Ooops -- you weren't referring to mothers were you?  Actually, the title of ""doctor"" derives from the Latin verb to teach and applied to university faculty long before it was applied to medical doctors.  At one college where I was on the faculty I went by my first name with students, because the environment was more casual.  At other schools where I have taught, I have been known as Dr. Thornton because the norm was for faculty to be known by their name and title.  Dr. Biden should continue to use whatever title is common at the university where she teaches.  Her husband's career should not diminish the work she has accomplished over her lifetime!"
Samuel Contreras,Thanks for sharing
William Moore,"Was this really an honest effort to engage critically with the subject of inconsistent standards for using the honorific of ""Doctor"" in social situations? Or to debate the consequences of  the proliferation of honorary degrees and lowered standards in academia more generally speaking? Or was it just a cheap shot at a distinguished and respectable woman? Dr. Biden is an educator - someone who contributes positively to the future of our society. Further, she possesses a terminal degree - the very standard that the article states is what generally determines whether someone has earned the  title ""doctor."" Frankly, the author's attempts at overly-friendly belittlement (""kiddo,"" really?) come across as borderline sexist and definitely patronizing. At the risk of being accursed of trying to ""censor the right"" I'm honestly surprised the WSJ chooses to feature this nonsense in their op-ed column.  It's petty. "
J Badger,"Very well said, Mr. Moore, although your expression of surprise suggests perhaps you've wisely been avoiding the WSJ opinion section for quite some time."
Kate Cannon,Well said.
Cynthia Tallman,"Massive miscue by editorial folks at WSJ. Have you people been around and aware during the last few years?  You know, ME TOO, BLM, and the like. Who knew that ALL people like  to be respected. The 80 plus year old who wrote this may have missed  what's going on and the need to honor and respect all others, what's the WSJ's excuse? Shame, shame shame. Never should have made it to print on your pages. "
sean kelly,"Sad day please cancel my subscription I don't know Mr Epstein but from what he's provided here I can only offer that the expression of his views fall far below the standards I expect from WSJ ... to the point of offense ... in a world where we especially now are looking for standard-bearers, or affirmations of such, I'm not only disappointed in wsj, I'm broken ... please cancel my subscription unless you're willing to toe the line and get back immediately to your reflections born of wisdom, objectivity, and pragmatism ... not this ilth.... be better indeed ... "
Kathleen Corbett,"Sounds like somebody's got a pretty acute case of Doctorate envy. Dr. Biden's got nothing to prove, but apparently you do, Mr. Epstein. "
Samuel Contreras,Exactly. 
Suzanne Lanoue,"Ridiculous. Although it may seem a bit pretentious for a professor to use the Dr. title, many do, commonly. And in many universities, all the people who work for professors call them ""Doctor"" whether they want them to or not. An EDD is just as much of a doctorate as a PhD, a DMA or any other doctorate. While it's true that you can get a doctorate without being brilliant (the same is true for medical doctors), it's rare. I don't know why you would go on and on about a honorary doctorate (which is, indeed, meaningless).  It makes no sense since Jill Biden doesn't have one of those. You sound like a stuck up old fart who's jealous that he doesn't have a real doctorate. Worse, you shows yourself to be both racist and sexist in your comments.  Also, you should be lucky to be anywhere near as smart as either Seth Meyers or Stephen Colbert. "
Anne Cramer,"Well, Joseph Epstein, BA, I hope you think your 2 minutes of fame is worth the public embarrassment and tarnish to whatever pitiful reputation you may have. Your resentment demonstrates your  stupidity,  jealousy and pettiness? Just go away. "
Stuart Johnson,"How does this stuff get published? What a nonsensical piece. I truly don't understand the purpose of this rhetoric, other than to grandstand over a silly non-issue.Everything outside of the Opinion section is still reputable at the WSJ. Opinion-section editors, get it together."
Mary Stam,"Petty, petty, petty. They're not even in the white house yet and already the misogynists are attacking. That's 5 minutes I won't get back."
Peter Noymer,"Hi Joe,Sorry to see that your insecurities, ignorance and hatred have made you write this drivel, and even more sorry (but not in the least surprised) that the Journal gave you a forum for this. Having worked very hard for my Ph.D. in chemical engineering from MIT, I'm keeping my ""Dr."" title, thank you very much. And by the way, Northwestern dropped you from their website. Boom!Dr. Grace E. Colon"
Mark B,-Misogyny.-Veiled Racism. -Moral Obtuseness-Lack of Self-Awareness-Toxic Resentment of Others Masked as (Utterly Failed) Wit-Lack of perspective. Banality. -Ignoring the trashing of American democracy by the president.All the ingredients for the perfect WSJ Opinion piece
John Cowan,"When I started reading WSJ opinion article commentaries, they consisted almost entirely of empty affirmations of polemics, and sneering putdowns of ""liberals"". But, where were the actual liberals who would carefully rebut  the polemics? Didn't they know that they needed to subscribe and do a necessary political duty? So I dipped my own toe into the water several times and flushed out other readers able to turn the effort into a productive multi-faceted discussion. Welcome aboard, Mark B!  Your 39 word response rings truer than the entire Epstein piece. "
Samuel Contreras,Indeed. 
W Kroll,"What other motive could there be for this piece other than to be petty and snarky? This was weird. Criticize all you like about things said, actions taken, political positions. Go for it. But this? Really? The WSJ should be better than this - or shall I go petty and snarky and instead suggest that the WSJ should ""Be Best."" "
MARY L DION SCURLOCK,"Disgraceful, disgusting piece.  Doctor Biden clearly invested far more time and effort in her intellectual  development and life than Mr. Epstein did, and surely is making a far more worthwhile  and lasting contribution to  her community.Pathetic that the WSJ  published this.  We will not be renewing our subscription.Mary L. Dion, M.D."
Francis Mwaisela,For four years we have had to listen to the WSJ bow down to the now impeached one term President call himself the greatest whatever.Now we have some decent Americans entering the White House with reputable titles hard earned coming face with an article like this which speaks volumes about the messenger and the vehicle carrying it.So sad!
Robert Lichtenstein,The fact that this drivel was published in the supposedly reputable WSJ makes it is not even worth the special trial $4.00/month yearly subscription I just canceled after less than a week. 
GARY FIELD,"The (non-medical) ""Doctor"" title is appropriate in academic settings, but not elsewhere. Convention matters: Henry Kissinger was often referred to ""Dr. Kissinger"" in the UK, but not in the US. Americans typically avoid titles - often considering them to be a sign of pretension.US lawyers, like other common law countries, used to receive a LL.B. degree (Bachelor of Legal Letters). That degree in the UK is a first degree, unlike the US where a pre-law first Bachelor's degree must be completed. Someday, somebody presumably said ""Let's change the name, but not the content"", so now in the US (and sometimes in Canada) we have Juris Doctor degrees, but nobody uses the ""Doctor"" title.In the UK (and Australia) medical degrees are MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), but recipients are called ""Doctor"". Specialist surgeons are given the title ""Mister"" (women surgeons use Miss/Ms/Mrs).""Doctor"" is an occupational title, outside academia, it should be exclusively used that way."
FRANCIS LA POLL,"For many years, one earned the Bachelor of Laws degree in two years.  Juris Doctor was more than a change in name.  It required a third year.   "
GARY FIELD,Canadian lawyers complete either a LLB or JD degree. They are both three years in length.
FRANCIS LA POLL,Thank you for pointing out the distinction in our two countries' approaches to legal education.   I meant only to comment on the program in the U.S. 
Francis Carbone,"I think I get your point - medical doctors can use the title since that's their occupation.   Like ""Reverend"" is used by those of the cloth even outside a church setting.  So Jill Bidden can be known as Professor Biden since that's her occupational title.  I don't know whether that would be acceptable to Mr Epstein - although from the omission in the narrative, I'm sure he had no problems with it for himself. "
GARY FIELD,"True, Professor would be a more appropriate title as it identifies her profession. We see that used, for example, when Professor Dershowitz (a lawyer) is interviewed. Naturally, in academic settings, the title is also appropriate. If Jill Biden was writing or speaking on matters relevant to he area of expertise, professor would certainly be relevant - it shows she has recognized expertise in the topic at hand.In non-work related situations (especially social ones) where the fact that someone is a doctor (MD), professor or admiral in their woking life, the use of a title is a bit of an affectation. This is especially so in a country which professes to be classless (I know that's not the reality, but it's the aspiration)."
Francis Carbone,"But that is not the line taken by Mr Epstein in his essay, since he thinks it's inappropriate to use the honorific in an academic setting.  I prefer being called by my first name.  But where a formal professional courtesy is required, it would be downright bizarre for someone to use mister and not doctor or professor (eg in an introduction as an invited lecturer).  Interestingly, Mr Epstein's hasn't earned the right to either of these titles.  He points out that he has no PhD, but neither was he a professor at NU - the university link, now removed, said he was a lecturer.  I wonder if he made a fuss at being introduced as ""Professor"" for a speaking engagement?"
a f,"Joseph Epstein sounds a bit bitter and certainly resentful that a woman should carry a professional, hard-earned title such as ""Dr."" without being an MD. Instead of bitching,  moaning, and belittling her through editorials that have no merit, and should never have been published by any outlet, much less one that claims to be a respectable publication, then could he could experience how much work a post-graduate degree is, and why that title is now part of who she is. Once completed, he could then realize that her degree is not just some letters to make herself sound worldly but is  worthy of preceding her name because ***SHE EARNED IT***."
Rieva Lesonsky,"This is sexist. I'd say I can't believe you'd print this trash, but unfortunately I can. "
Kyle Manuel,"If it was an honorary doctorate maybe I could get behind this, but a doctorate is a hard earned degree, you earn that right to be called doctor. Just because it isn't in medicine doesn't mean it's not a doctorate. I'm quite disappointed that these are the kinds of articles WSJ is putting out. The fact that this is what is being published is very sad to see. Whether you support Biden or not doesn't change the fact she earned her doctorate. The whole bit with honorary doctorates has nothing to do with the EARNED degree that Dr. Jill Biden earned. Show some respect to the hard work of individuals honorary ""Dr. "" Epstein."
David Sims,"From the description of the author's life in academia - and for a piece on Dr. Jill Biden, we hear an awful lot about *him* - it seems to me it is he who is fraudulent (though not quite so comic as he clearly believes himself to be)."
Peter Sowards,"How embarrassing for the Wall Street Journal, a supposed pinnacle of informed and fair-minded journalism in today's polarized landscape. Be better. "
Elizabeth Ramsey,"WSJ should withdraw this opinion piece by Joseph Epstein.  It's beneath them, or should be.Past that, who is Mr. Epstein to address Dr. Biden, an incoming First Lady,  as he did in the piece?    His remarks reek of disrespect, misogyny and if I may say so, an obvious insecurity."
JANE ANTLEY,"I disagree.  He's stating the obvious, but not popular, opinion.  Referring to Jill Biden as a Doctor, except in her professional education capacity, is simply ridiculous, pretentious and kind of pathetic!"
Bridget Koerwitz,But would the same thing be said about a man?
David Sims,Never.
JANE ANTLEY,"I would assume that the likes of Joseph Epstein and me would be laughing just as heartily, if not more so, if a man were trying to inflate his stature!  I know I would!"
Bridget Koerwitz,"But by mentioning his honorary doctorate, he is inflating his stature. It's an inherently sexist opinion to hold, and muddled by a complete lack of self-awareness. Incredibly close-minded. That's the point here. "
Bradley Smith,Right. The guy who couldn't get more than an honorary doctorate is mocking a woman who earned a real doctorate. Methinks he doth protest too much. 
Elizabeth Ramsey,"Epstein is who was obviously pathetic:. Addressing any woman as ""kiddo""  was intentionally condescending and disrespectful,  especially when trying to make an unwarranted point about a female with an earned doctorate (who also happens to be an incoming First Lady but not of the political stripe preferred by the editorial management of the WSJ).So long as that  editorial management does not change, patently reactionary views of  the America we live in now  will continue to show up on occasion.   I'm not that surprised to have seen  contempt for an educated woman appear in these pages during the ""reign"" of a notoriously misogynistic and nominally conservative Republican president.  "
Pat Wirry,I'll bet Epstein would have written the same article had the husband of President Jill Biden referred to himself as Dr. Joe with identical credentials.  
Chris Berkeley,"Mr. Epstein has thoroughly embarrassed himself with this disgraceful opinion piece. As a graduate from Northwestern and University of Chicago, (Mr. Epstein used the names of these two universities to boost his credibility in the article), I will be asking my two alma-maters to denounce this man's horrible insult to every person who worked hard to earn a doctorate. It is, however, not very surprising for Mr. Epstein to do this kind of thing - he was fired from his job for being a blatant homophobe once already. Shameful."
Brenda Rinard,"I am a liberal Biden supporter, but I subscribe to The WSJ because I believe in hearing alternative viewpoints. I don't want to live in an echo chamber in which I hear my opinions thrown back at me. But this piece made me comment here for the first time.  It's a cheap, ill-informed, sexist shot at a well-educated, competent woman.  What was the purpose in publishing this drivel? We are not more informed or enlightened by reading it, so why bother? If I wanted content as vapid as this, I wouldn't need to pay for a subscription to The Wall Street Journal. I'd just go to youtube to listen to Diamond and Silk. Disagree with liberal policies and do so in reasoned arguments. That's why I subscribe. Otherwise I won't bother to come back."
Masood Mortazavi,"Indeed . . . . ""What was the purpose in publishing this drivel?"" . . . . . I do wonder. "
GARY FIELD,"Newcomers to the WSJ often criticize them for not using titles. The WSJ typically refer to Mr. Trump instead of President Trump and Mr. Schumer instead of Senator Schumer. It's stylistic, not an indication of disrespect. Henry Kissinger was always referred to as ""Mr. Kissinger"" (not just by the WSJ), but in the UK, for example, he was known as ""Dr. Kissinger"". Unlike the US, titles are more widely used in the hierarchical UK society. ""Equality"" is a more dominant sentiment in the US. ""Doctor"" is an occupational title, so it is appropriate to refer to Dr. Fauci because the title is relevant to medical authority. Otherwise, the use of the term for holders of PhD, EdD, DBA, DEng etc. degrees is more appropriately confined to academia."
J Badger,"This comment is quite incorrect as to WSJ style. The WSJ does use ""President Trump"" and ""Senator Schumer"" etc. on first reference in an article, and reverts to Mr./Ms. on second and further references, with rule-based exceptions, e.g., when the title is contained in a description of the individual immediately preceding the first reference, as in ""Two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, reiterated....""This can be easily confirmed with a casual inspection of any given article. There are, of course, occasional errors or omissions, as it would appear that today's copyeditors are somewhat less than perfectly diligent."
GARY FIELD,"You are being a bit pedantic here. Yes, the WSJ uses the title at the start, then switches (I have been a subscriber for over 40 years).WSJ newcomers occasionally write to criticize the use of Mr. in the ongoing article. My comment was really directed at those who disapproved of this stylistic practice."
Bob Foster,"If you work at a university and don't have a PhD, you can be made to feel inferior. Alternatively, you can be addressed as Dr. because people assume the honorific for certain positions. Apparently, both happened to Mr. Epstein, and he is sensitive about it.That gives him no license to address Dr. Biden as ""kiddo"" and make sneering remarks about enjoying life in ""the best public housing in the world"". And the long paragraphs about honorary degrees leading up to a demeaning reference to Dr. Biden's EdD, as though it were somehow as worthless as the one the writer holds, are pure jackassery. Of course, it is natural for the Journal editors, after years of Trump apologetics, to assume that belittling the accomplishments of women is normal, accepted behavior. It isn't either. Stow it."
Masood Mortazavi,"Do we really need, as readers, to be subjected to the level of baseness embodied in Mr. Epstein's piece?Would someone please tell the opinion page editor to exercise greater care and diligence in selecting columnists?There seems to be a litany of extremists  who are constantly being provided with the soapbox. If the opinion editor is incapable of being awake at the wheel, perhaps it is time for a reassignment or a change of staff?"
Joseph Goswitz,I'm really surprised that the editorial board chose to waste space on such a small minded piece of writing.
Brad Biales,"Are there any editors at the WSJ?  On what principles did you decide to print this?  Guess the competition for lowering standards is just too tough.  I would expect this kind of B.S. from the president, quoting fox or oann, or that great thinker, Rush Limbaugh, but not from a newspaper that used to be prestigious. The article speaks more of the author's inferiority complex and unfinished business with women than it does about anything else.  I cannot understate my disappointment as I watch a paper like the WSJ continue to lower its standards of decency and professional journalism.  You go.  "
Roger Guttentag,"I find it incomprehensible that a newspaper occupying the top ranks of journalism would waste ink and electrons on the unbelievably trivial issue of academic title usage.  In my very humble opinion, if someone earned a PhD through honest hard work they are entitled to use it in any manner that is reasonably appropriate.  Mr. Epstein's rant against legitimate academic credentials, especially for the purpose of denigrating Dr. Biden, came across as exceedingly mean-spirited and  small minded.  Given the considerable sum I pay for subscribing to this paper I would appreciate it very much if the WSJ could kindly focus on more important subjects."
JANE ANTLEY,"I thought it was a lighthearted, timely and funny piece!  He's not the only one who's been put off by her ""Dr. "" silliness!"
Leon Granowitz,"You are being silly, ma'am."
Bridget Koerwitz,"I think this article is a disgrace to journalism. You speak about honorary degrees, but in no way is DOCTOR Biden's degree ""honorary."" You're comparing her hard with with your honorary doctorate you choose not to recognize because you didn't earn it and it does feel wrong to say it. Also, to comment about a dissertation written on community colleges is disappointing. It contributes to the failing education system in our country. People like you try to demean the hard work that (primarily disadvantaged) students who attend community colleges put into a degree. I'm sorry, but last time I checked, a degree is a degree no matter where it came from. If C's can get degrees, than a dissertation gets a doctorate. And when you receive a doctorate, even as First Lady, you're not Misses, you're a doctor. Do not discredit the hard work of another person because you can't achieve what she did. She is an expert in her field. You are not. Stay in your lane. "
Kathi Jackson,"I agree with your comment about the article being a disgrace. I just wanted to correct your perception that community colleges are primarily used by disadvantaged students. It has become extremely common for students who come from families throughout the socioeconomic spectrum who could probably have afforded and gotten accepted at a four-year college to complete their basic requirements at community colleges, earning an AA degree. Saving money on a couple of years of college has become relevant to a wide range of people who are trying to avoid crippling debt. The classes at community colleges are smaller than the large and impersonal lecture classes at universities. The professors can devote their energy to teaching rather than having to also focus on research and publishing articles in order to obtain tenure."
Tyler Jarvis,Why would the WSJ even publish this garbage?
Andrew Sullivan,Epstein suffers from BIDEN DERANGEMENT SYNDROME
Masood Mortazavi,"I hear some narcissists who may suffer from some acute deficiency in intelligence have trouble recognizing or tolerating it in others. Many agree that Pr. Trump is a prime case of the malady. Here, Mr. Epstein has earned his own unique place in the case histories. "
Leah Gallo,The misogyny in this article is disgusting. Seriously considering cancelling my subscription if WSJ has sunk so low asto think it's worth giving this guy's jealousy and condescension to women (kiddo? Really?) any space.
Masood Mortazavi,Idiots cannot recognize intelligence when they see it. 
JANE ANTLEY,"I still think it's very pretentious that Jill Biden, in public life, wants to be known as Dr. Jill Biden.  It's strictly a professional designation, only applicable to her work at the college level.  It's cringeworthy, and Epstein calls it out, and I couldn't agree more!"
Victoria Baumfield,"Then why is it OK when a medical doctor uses their title socially?  If don't need to  know that I'm dealing with a medical doctor unless I need to see one, right?  Completing a dissertation is the hardest thing that most people will ever do.   Denigrating the use of a title that one has more than earned says more about you, and your obvious jealousy, than about her."
RAYMOND  L MARIANI,"I have subscribed to the wsj for years.  But maybe it's time to stop when you give valuable space to something this ignorant. The author clearly has no clue about the work to achieve a doctorate degree.   He does not have one and never tried.  His claim to fame is sitting in on someone else's dissertation defense.  Wow. Do I sense some jealousy that Dr Biden may be much smarter and more accomplished than the author?  Also FYI: In other countries, people with a JD are also referred to as doctor.  It's a sign of respect.  Something the author clearly lacks.  Finally, was there no other person using the Dr title before the first lady elect who would have also warranted the  same criticism by the author?  Or just coincidental it's a woman.  We all know the editorial page retort regarding content censorship. But your customers are paying for this content. So publish something we need, eg discuss the merits of Dr Biden's work rather than attacking her for using the same title as men use. "
J Rossi,"I just subscribed to this pub for the ""privelege"" of responding to your worthless opinion piece on Dr. Jill Biden. That any institution, entity, organization would lower its standards so far as to charitably bestow upon you a degree other than P.O.S. with distinction to the nth power is as mind blowing as the notion you are Jewish, Canadian, or human. Congratulations on replacing the occupant as America's new torchbearer of despicability. "
Sean Aron,"People with PhDs are called Doctor. That's how it works.So let's be clear, this is an editorial saying you wish to change the standard of the English language because you don't like the current president-elect. No, that's not how it works. You don't get to decide how everyone else in the world speaks, and it takes an astonishing amount of hubris to stand here and say you do.This is without question the worst WSJ editorial I've ever read. You should do better than this, Murdoch."
Alan Kuska,"She's not a PhD. An EdD is more akin to a JD (lawyers) or DPT (physical therapists), neither of whom routinely go by ""doctor"" outside an academic context. I think Epstein was being petty, but let's stick with the facts. "
Suzanne Lanoue,"No, you're wrong. An EdD is the same as a PhD except that someone getting an EdD usually has to ALSO have professional teaching experience.  They do the same work to get their EdD as someone with a PhD except they also have to have that experience. Even Harvard has an EdD. You have to have an EdD to teach education in a university (usually). Just like you have to have a PhD to teach other fields."
Kathi Jackson,"An EdD is a doctoral degree.  I obtained a PhD in Clinical Psychology from a department of Psychology that also granted EdDs to people who specialized in Educational Psychology.  There is an equal amount of work involved in obtaining these degrees, simply in different areas of a field. It is ridiculous to make the comparison with JDs and PTs. Although someone mentioned that attorneys are called ""Doctor"" in some countries, and people in the field of PT can obtain a doctorate in this field.  It is perfectly appropriate for Jill Biden to be referred to as Dr. Biden. And as some have said, I seriously doubt that this would have come up if it had to do with a man. For example, if Kamala Harris was married to a man with a doctorate, I doubt that people would bat an eyelash if he was referred to as Dr. "
Victoria Baumfield,"Not true.  I have a JD and was just informed last week that my PhD thesis passed.  An Ed D requires a dissertation/thesis (the language varies depending on where you do it) just like a PhD.   It has NOTHING in common with a JD.  And writing a passing thesis/dissertation is the hardest thing most people will ever do.   So sorry, Alan, but you are 100% incorrect.   "
Masood Mortazavi,"One of the worst I've read, too, and I've read plenty of bad ones, here . . .It may be time for a change of guard and staff in the opinion section of the WSJ . . . "
Jarrod San Angel,@wallstreetjournal: Pathetic pontificator Epstein is costing you a lot of subscriptions -- including mine. Rubbish like this has no place in an ostensibly respectable publication such as yours. Disgusting. 
Tom Goslin,This is so Trumpy 
Barry Brigham,"With all of the unprecedented and frankly, scary events of the last week - this snarky, vapid piece is what the WSJ EB decided to go with? Disappointing is an understatement. I will be cancelling my subscription at the end of this month."
Pat Hadler,New WSJ subscriber here. I cannot believe you published this patronizing and demeaning opinion piece.  Is this really how you as an organization regard educated and accomplished women? A retraction and apology to the First Lady-elect is in order. Otherwise I'm canceling my subscription.
Sharon Stout,"University statement on Joseph Epstein
Media News dot Northwestern dot edu Joseph Epstein was never a tenured professor at Northwestern and has not been a lecturer here since 2002.

While we firmly support academic freedom and freedom of expression, we do not agree with Mr. Epstein's opinion and believe the designation of doctor is well deserved by anyone who has earned a Ph.D., an Ed.D. or an M.D.  

Northwestern is firmly committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, and strongly disagrees with Mr. Epstein's misogynistic views.

Northwestern's Department of English also has issued a statement, which can be found on the department website."
Sharon Stout,"Sources and links: University statement on Joseph Epstein https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/12/joseph-epstein-statement/&fj=1DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISHThe Department is aware that a former adjunct lecturer who has not taught here in nearly 20 years has published an opinion piece that casts unmerited aspersion on Dr. Jill Biden's rightful public claiming of her doctoral credentials and expertise. The Department rejects this opinion as well as the diminishment of anyone's duly-earned degrees in any field, from any university.https://english.northwestern.edu/This story is also being covered in other newspapers, social media, etc.  "
David Sims,I was wondering when this would appear.
Mr Hosking,So Northwestern University is woke?  I am shocked. 
David Sims,"To denigrate Dr. Biden's hard work, sacrifice, and even her dissertation shows a disgusting lack of respect for an intelligent, accomplished woman.  Is it all women who presume to do what only men were, for so long, thought capable of achieving that bothers you - or is it personal?After Mrs. Trump, who wow'd us with her nude modelling and her sacrifice in wooing the (at that time, already married) man she did, I'd think you might - as ""a wise man once said"" - see an upside to having Dr. Biden serving as a model of what a woman might achieve (even one who's 55).America may not respect expertise or accomplishment, but that tells us more about America than it does about those who possess expertise and have accomplished something.Forget the small thrill of insulting Dr. Jill, and settle for the larger thrill of having a White House filled once again with people of competence, civility, and integrity.I'm not a doctor myself, but I diagnose imposter syndrome; I hope you survive it."
Tyler Jarvis,Okay kiddo.
Victoria Baumfield,"John, it must be nice to be a (I'm guessing) white man.  How many times have you been asked to type up your colleagues' notes, be the one to order/fetch lunch or coffees, or ignored because it was assumed that you were the secretary?  I have two Ivy League degrees including a JD and was many times dismissed as the secretary by people who did not know better, or, when I worked in France, treated worse than our hired (male) assistants by a male boss who did.  All that is why I added the honorific ""Esq."" to my email signature, despite it feeling incredibly gauche.  It cut down on the emails that were filtered into the ""ignore"" bin by opposing counsels' secretaries.   Last week I was told that my PhD thesis  has passed.  In about a month I will be told that I have completed the requirements to use the title ""Dr."".  Why do I suspect that some people outside my academic institution will not treat me with the respect that you obviously receive if I do not use the title ostentatiously?"
Kimberley Morgan,"You must not understand what the word 'doctor' means otherwise you wouldn't written this post. Dr. Biden earned a doctorate degree. Dr. Biden, which earned her the right to be called 'Dr. Biden'. Also, as someone who works closely with surgeon/scientists, I can 100% tell you my colleagues agree with me, not because of an opinion, because of facts. "
timothy fitzpatrick,having done my fellowship as a surgeon i am once again a mister. 
nancy boudreau,"Such an offensive, op-ed by a man with NO credentials and NO authority to question anyones education and to target a woman who has earned her Ph.D.  I  say this as a retired academic with a PhD who was an endowed professor at one of the top  US medical schools and also a branch chief at the NIH . I guess since I never delivered someone else's baby I don't deserve to be called Dr. either? What has happened to the WSJ op-ed page? After allowing Peggy Noonan to attribute all the conventional negatives of female candidates to Kamala Harris ( not likeable , frivolous etc) and now this? WTF "
leila kashani,I am canceling mine.

David Sims,"Let's hear it for all the taxi drivers who will soon be getting a ""promotion"" - so many of them having honorably discharged the ""duties"" of showing kindness to a woman in need (and giving so many strong, healthy babies a good solid start in life), rather than taking a very public misogynistic dump on her diploma."
Elizabeth Bear,"The bitter ramblings of a man who only achieved an ""honorary doctorate"", and to this day seeks here to put down those with the real thing, inside what really is nothing other than an advertisement for how superior you yourself are - to Dr. Biden and to I don't know who all.Your Northwestern to her University of Delaware, your ""professorship"" to her Dissertation on ""community college"" - which is far more crucial an issue nationally than your professorship I daresay - your ""peace time soldiering"" as a sort of superior stance to those who sit for their degree (instead you were sitting around getting paid by the govt when you completed your degree - wow! but my Dad served as a naval officer in Korea see, so yeah, nah.What truly revolting drivel from a man has yet to achieve the self confidence to recognize your own poor and transparent excuse for attention - you use Dr. Biden to get people to read about you - but you are not very interesting."
Mark Phelan,Bill Cosby is as much a doctor as is Jill Biden. They have the same degrees.
Robin M Cohen,"Wow, if I  were Dr. Jill Biden,  I wouldn't honor your arrogant huffing and puffing with any attention at all. "
Diana Zinn,"I only recently subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and after reading this drivel, I am already planning to cancel my subscription.  "
Melissa Bursch,"I am also disappointed that the WSJ published a troll article like this.   I just finished a 66 hour week working on cutting edge AI and it was a breeze compared to any single week of my wife in grad school.  I couldn't be more proud of her.  If this author said something like this to her, I would have to step in-between them so he couldn't sue us after she kicked his a...- Anton  "
David Sims,"I believe you are too kind in your assumption about the author's intent (and very possibly the paper's intent on deciding to publish it).  This was clearly designed as a mean-spirited put-down of the incoming President and his family.  That it is so misogynistic too is just a ""bonus."""
Oliver Small,"This is a disgusting, insulting article. I am ashamed to have recently subscribed to a newspaper that published this type of disgraceful trash. I really thought Wall Street Journal was more classy and respectful. The editor and Mr Epstein should both take a hard look at their moral values and remind themselves this is the 21st century, or just go back to the hovel they came from. Disgusting. "
Leighann Dudley,"Hey, person who wrote this article, do you not realize that DR is not just reserved for those with a MD? It's also for people with doctorates? You know PHDs? Yeah.Anyways, have you never been to a college campus? You think my professor in the music building whom I call Dr knows how to do my heart surgery?  Good god."
Burton F. Myers,What nonsense for the WSJ. Weenies.
Pat Wirry,Because your daughters are teenagers you're cancelling your subscription?  Care to explain?
Shawn Wheelock,"""Kiddo""?  I do believe that if any newspaper published a piece addressing a Republican First Lady this way, the opinion page of this newspaper would be alight with indignation.  You guys never cease to amaze me with your flagrant double standards.   And you expect me to trust your views on things?  Your news is excellent, but the opinion page increasingly lacks integrity.    I  have been considering canceling my subscription for some time, and It is clear that this is not going to improve.   I don't think I am willing to pay for this anymore."
David Sims,Your doctorate is in which field?...asking for a friend
Jim Walsh,"Why does the  friend care? The subject at hand is that an EdD is not as highly regarded as an MD. See a ""doctorate "" in a field is not the same as  being ""medical doctor "" .Try to keep up. "
David Sims,"Oh I'm keeping up, Kiddo.  I do realize the difference between a medical doctor and a person holding a doctorate degree in another field.  I've stood in some of those fields myself.The subject is a misogynistic put-down of Dr. Biden., something he would never do were Dr. Biden a man.  The author seems to me to be saying the EdD is not worth the paper it's printed on, let alone being less highly regarded than a medical doctor.  He's making a comparison, but the main thrust is to completely delegitimize her accomplishments (and by implication, delegitimize her husband's new gig).The opinion piece also uses Dr. Biden's name as clickbait, in order to get people to learn about him (and perhaps even sell a few of those books of his!).  As much time is spent sharing his own story as denigrating hers; nice to have a woman with a doctorate to use as an attention grabber for a guy who wouldn't get the time of day on his own.Oh, and thank you for your ever so gracious response."
Jim Walsh,"I disagree, the subject is Jill  Biden and the media pumping up her resume because they don't think much of being an English teacher.  Oh, I missed the kiddo at first, nice play. "
JANE ANTLEY,"Me, too!  "
Clay Thomas,"Gentleman, Without a clear direct object, I can only infer you are concerned for my backside. I intend to exit swiftly but am willing to hold the door for the ill and well mannered seeking thought provoking content. "
Scott L,One must tread lightly to avoid triggering the woke (sic) hall monitors. Clearly expressed objects and often even subjects of sentences are not always appreciated.
Pat Wirry,"Why should I know or care about a game score, Michael?  We were discussing a person with an EdD referring to themselves by their first name preceded by the title Dr. I think it sounds ridiculous.  Why not explain why you think it's appropriate or common practice?"
Sophia Li,"I am so ashamed to be a WSJ subscriber. Did you really just call the incoming First Lady ""kiddo"" in the very first line? What an incredibly sexist and condescending piece, and the fact that you published it speaks volumes about what you stand for as a publication. Disgraceful."
Cynthia Sweet,"Wow! Jealous much? Do you also begrudge men with PhDs who carry the honorific Dr as a part of their title?  Your rude, inappropriate, and demeaning article about a traditional honorific which has been in use since the 13th century is ridiculous and ill timed at best.  Have any titles or honorifics you can give up to satisfy someone's fragile ego? "
Pat Wirry,"What does the color of one's skin and age have to do with someone commenting on the use of  the name ""Dr. Jill""?   We all recognize referring to someone with a PhD as doctor outside of academia is pretentious and coupled with just the first name sounds ridiculous.  Be that as it may, she can call herself whatever she likes. "
Stephen Spelman,"This article is despicable.  Just saw that this four-word comment was flagged for review.  If it's deemed unacceptable, please let me know, and I'll write those same four words to your publisher by hand.  Colonel (Retired) Stephen E. Spelman)"
Charles Sheridan,"Mr. Epstein (not ""Dr."" because you certainly don't deserve it), this is simply a pathetic, petty, misogynistic, and minimizing piece of tripe that both you and WSJ should be ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it.  Dr. Biden's degree is not an ""honorific,"" it was a hard-earned, emphasis on the earned, title that she worked toward over years.  Anyone who put in the kind of time and effort necessary to earn this title, whether it's an M.D., a DDS, a J.D., an EdD, PhD, PsyD, etc., deserves the title, whether those like you, who resent those who achieved a higher level of educational attainment than you did., like it or not. I say again, pathetic."
Shimer George,"Joseph, you are lower than  pond scum. I am a Ph.D. in Biochemistry. I seldom use Dr. in my title but all my friends are curious why I don't use it all the time. They tell me ""You earned it!""  You would not have a clue hat it takes to earn that degree. the WSJ Editorial Board has sunk to to a new low publishing c r a p like this. You should be ashamed. "
dena ducane,Terminating my subscription tomorrow 
Mr Hosking,"I am sure the New York Times will welcome you back with open arms. The whole point of a commentary page is to provide you a variety of views. It's sad that you believe that the WSJ should censor Mr Epstein just because some might disagree or find his opinions offensive.And yes, my Red Guardian I am quite certain I would like to post this comment. "
Chris David,"Speak for yourself - I assure you the last thing the WSJ is to lose subscribers... especially to The Times.  This Epstein fellow certainly is not cutting a check to the Journal for lost revenue. So unlike you, I doubt they will be overly enthused to see notice of cancellations. Enjoy!  If i'm wrong, then let's hear it WSJ..."
Alec Weibel,"Epstein, kiddo: You're a joke. Hope WSJ decides they're done with you after this. Yuck. "
vera cole,"Oh snore. She earned it and so did Dr. Martin Luther King. But hey, I don't see you telling his relatives to ""drop the honorific."" It's mansplaying, pure and simple. And btw, you just earned a BA right? Or was it a B of S?  Either way, if 45 had earned it, you'd be calling him ""Doc"" all the way to Rupert Murdoch's bank."
Khooshbu Jaiswal,What a piece of nonsense#@!#%
Eric McFarland,Wow - In deciding to publish Mr. Epstein's valueless opinion the WSJ has dipped to new lows that I thought were unreachable.  Perhaps a disdain for educational achievement and excellence recognized by the award of a doctoral degree helps explain the embrace of Trumpism by this once great publication.  Consider my subscription cancelled.   
dan stropes,"After the 4+ year diatribe against the Trump family I'm surprised anyone is offended by Mr Epstein's attack against a Biden family member.
However, considering the sensitivity shown by the WSJ censors, it's unusual to see publication of such a negatively slanted article.
Yes i am sure I want to post this comment.

"
Erin McLaughlin,"I am a part-time PhD student (at 45), an executive,  and a woman.  Because of this ridiculous column and the drivel allowed on these editorial pages of late I am seriously considering canceling my subscription (held for years). Your commentary is insulting and misogynistic. (And who--given the state of our education and workforce--would  seemingly belittle the analysis of community college student retention and resources?) You may have an ""honorary doctorate"" but not much honor, MR. Epstein."
Will Vandiver,"What a clown. Come on, WSJ. Have some standards. You embarrass yourselves."
Denise Berger,"Joseph Epstein, or should I stoop to your level to call you, ""kiddo"" or address you as Joey? WOW!  Your op-ed piece is childlike, resounding with deep-seeded bitterness, perhaps that you, yourself, never earned a doctorate? You come across, frankly, as VERY ignorant of all the work that goes into earning an EdD or a PhD. You also sound like a chauvinist and misogynist when you ask DR. Biden to rest her laurels on being the wife of the President. YUCK! Gross. You clearly lack emotional intelligence to have written such a spiteful, jealous, obnoxious, unprofessional, classless message. To take away this woman's accomplishments demeans her and frankly is worrisome that you are a graduate-level educator, and are in a position of power to affect other women's trajectories! YIKES, Joey! I feel badly for you that - with everything going on in the world - you have underlying issues of resentment and anger that led you to write this. Why the WSJ allowed it to be published? Shame on them."
Jim Walsh,"Thanks for your efforts, but don't try to defend the average big city union teacher. Most can't even pass the same tests they give the student. I tutored a few of them in math while in college.  "
Pat Wirry,"Jill Biden doesn't have a PhD, she earned an EdD. She can call herself whatever she likes, but Dr. Jill sounds  like a take off on Judge Judy."
Kate Cannon,"An EdD is a terminal degree and equivalent to a Ph.D. in Education. Both require advanced research in the field of education. An EdD is for practitioners and educational leaders. Jill Biden does not refer to herself as  ""Dr. Jill."" That was the rude title Mr. Epstein used in the article. She has been referred to as Dr. Biden in professional settings. That is perfectly appropriate. Your reference to Judge Judy is just baffling. "
Baruch S,The bar for WSJ opinion articles is at an all time low.  And WHY is this message flagged for moderation by WSJ..... ? 
Mr Hosking,Oh look a woke woman attacking a writer and an entire group of people based on their age and the color of their skin. Very enlightened Ms Brinkman. 
Mr Hosking,Chiropractors also have a doctorate degree. So do lawyers. 
Susan Jacks,"If you're so concerned about women ""cheapening"" the use of the word ""Dr."" in front of their names, you might go after your boy Trump for cheapening the awarding of the Medal of Freedom to wrestling coaches and racists."

Thomas Garruto,Lol this is trash. 
Bill Brown,"What an asinine opinion piece.  Is this what the WSJ has fallen to -- a misogynistic hit piece by a cranky old man?  I would hope for better, not nastier, going forward."
Mark Phelan,Bill Cosby has an Ed.D. just like Jill Biden. Don't see anyone calling him Dr. Cosby.
John Murphy,"The crux of this article is found in the following quote:""I . . . [blah, blah, blah] . . . without a doctorate or any advanced degree.""Please find somebody kind to give you a big 'ol hug.By the way, you can always go back to school--like Dr. Jill Biden did."
Elizabeth Ramsey,"Wow.  If a woman had written this about a guy with a doctorate,  all y'all guys sitting around taking a break from the trading floor might have read it and chalked it up to penis envy. Not sure why WSJ elected to print this but I'm glad I'm paying the new promo rate or I'd probably just cancel the subscription.  Do better, WSJ.  Conservative editiorial opinion is one thing, but this is not that."
Sam Buggeln,"At long last sir, have you no shame? And WSJ editors, while it is fun to stir the pot from time to time, it is not cute to humiliate an elder by allowing such an intellectually incoherent, tonally-unhinged screed to see the light of day. Have some charity and say ""no"" next time."
John Hill,"As someone with a Ph.D. in economics , I couldn't care less about recognition of the title and have always wondered why those who hold Ph.D.'s (or come to  their aid in moments like this) do care.  The only time I take pleasure my title's use is when a  group of my favorite students call me Doc as a nickname.  Enjoy the opportunity to do what you love enabled by your degree and let the rest go - people that have a genuine life of the mind are too busy to make this an issue."
Tamar June,"Joe and Jill Biden have cheapened the presidency in more ways than one. For Joe, he is the kid who cheated in class by getting the final exam questions ahead of time and ""earned"" an ""A"",  knowing he didn't deserve it.  And yes, I believe the ""Dr"" should not be used by anyone except an MD. My father, a physician/surgeon, would agree. "
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.In fairness to Dr. Jill, her doctoral dissertation can't have been much worse than Dr. King's."
Thomas Knight,I am extremely disappointed in the WSJ for allowing this to be published. 
MARK DANLEY,"An MD earns the title Doctor because (s)he had completed 4 years of medical school. They don't become an actual practicing physician until they complete 2-6 years of residency.A person with a PhD or an Ed.D. earns the title of Doctor after 4 years of hard work, research, writing and publication.ANY  person with the title ""Doctor"" has earned the title, no matter what the field, MISTER Epstein.Your piece is merely sexist and an attempt to humiliate a woman who has actually EARNED her place and her title. "
DEBORAH Pines,"This is demeaning and sexist. I doubt the author meant to say  that only Ob-Gyns have the right to call themselves Dr.   Neurosurgeons, Proctologists, and Orthopedic Surgeons, don't have that right? This is clearly just the beginning of anti-Biden pecking away  at anything, whether real or not . But ""Jill..kiddo""?  Cut it out, Joey. "
Eric Graves,"Wow. Thirty year daily print subscriber here, and this transparently misogynistic drivel is a new low. Perhaps you should start advertising on Parler and OANN--this has, finally, given me real pause about renewing my subscription."
Elizabeth Bear,"A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child. - ah so I guess brain surgeons should drop the DR?Your honorary degree to her real doctorate - hmmm - I pick the real doctorate."
Thomas Lutz,This seems like one more  example  of the WSJ  finding  any fault at all with  the  Bidens....buckle up.
Sharon Stout,"I cancelled my WSJ account already.  I lost patience with the WSJ Editorial Board's foot-dragging in coming to terms with Trump's defeat.  But now this!   The snideness of the op-ed itself is matched only by some of the comments glossing over Epstein's sexist and racist presumption.  Dr. Jill Biden should listen to him and heed his advice -- why, exactly?   Perhaps Mr. Epstein's record in reforming Mr. Trump's speech and conduct has led to his presumption?  Where is that record?   "
Tony Tiger,"The convention is to avoid using  a doctoral title outside of professional life unless one is a medical doctor because of the social desirability of pinpointing medical help quickly in an emergency.  Having said that, strictly speaking it is the medical title that is honorary because it is conferred based on a first-degree in medicine whereas the doctorate is an educational level, not a professional title.  This early honorific is said to reflect the great respect accorded to medical science by universities.   It is the universities that define academic titles and, indeed, MDs  often continue to a PhD.   So really it is a matter of manners: don't cause social confusion with an academic title if you have one but neither should anyone seek to strip away earned distinctions. "
Alexander Baker,"You are reaching really far and straining really hard to excuse this.  It's simply not the case that people with non medical doctorates forgo their title in public, professional and social situations. In the time since that outdated convention was the norm, academia has grown and expanded where society benefits from the work of all sorts of professionals with doctorates - aka doctors.  If there's a medical emergency and someone calls for a doctor, non-medical doctors don't jump to attention because a) they are aware of the social convention, and b) they know their expertise aren't germane to the moment. "
David Gates,Mr. Epstein is a boor. The WSJ has exceedingly low standards for its Op-ed pieces.
Pat Wirry,"Perhaps, but the Doctor Jill bit is beyond ridiculous. "
David Gates,"I can't say - I've never met her.Apparently you have, but nonetheless I find your rude summary off-putting."
Kenneth Maxon,This editorial should be retracted and an apology issued to Dr. Biden. 
Joshua Stark,What is unpromising about the title of Dr. Biden's dissertation? Nothing. Not sure Mr. Epstein can understand the exigence of its subject matter based on the title alone. Mr. Epstein's lack of qualification in his choice of descriptors belies a larger problem. It seems as if Mr. Epstein might have unwittingly lodged his head so far up his own ars that his misunderstanding the politics of honorifics in professional life is precisely why he doesn't understand their function and/or use. Perhaps he should steer clear of PHD programs and look into a community college for that kind of enlightenment. Or perhaps it may be too late for that.JoshuaBorough of Manhattan Community College 
Alexander Baker,Well said. Agree with you wholeheartedly.You might wonder of that lump in Epstein's throat is his own nose...
Moshe Kam,"I became a subscriber to the WSJ knowing I disagree with the philosophy of its editorial board, and out of a desire to ""know the enemy."" Unlike others who were offended by the foolish diatribe of Mr. Epstein, I will not cancel my subscription in disgust.  I will just note that the enemy is shallow, small-minded, boorish, sexist and, most importantly, not terribly bright...this is good to know. "
PAUL MORAIS,"I did the same as you when i subscribed to the NYT. And i feel exactly the same way.  Small world, isn't it? "
Shawn Wheelock,"I am a moderate who subscribes to both.  And both disgust  me with their shallow, close-minded extremism.   They  mirror each other so very well. I decided yesterday to cancel my NYT subscription because they can't keep their opinions out of their news.  And this article was the final straw, I will be cancelling this subscription too.Neither side is my enemy.  We are all Americans."
Ann Hanham,"I have to question the WSJ publishing this trash. I have a PhD in molecular biology and take issue with this author who didn't complete the degree, but feels he can pontificate on the qualifications to be called Dr.  Next time, ask people who did the work.....Dr. Biden earned and deserves the title."
Naresh Kumar,I have a feeling this piece was supposed to be light-hearted and humorous. It was neither. And honorary degrees have no relevance to Jill Biden's earned doctorate. 
Kevin Smith,Mel has more viewers on x videos than on any broadcast network 
Peter Bartolik,What was the point of this? Has the WSJ gone as batty as the GOP AGs who sought to disenfranchise the citizens of four states whose presidential votes they disagreed with?
David Rawn,"There are two WSJs, the trashy editorial page and the superb newspaper. The editors should try reading it someday. Dr. Biden earned her degree. What's your problem, mr. Epstein?"
Jim Verrant,"MS Mathematics, University of Minnesota, 1965  ...  Now I look at the MS/Ma, PhD world and wonder what degrees are all about... I recently wrote the alumni club and reconfirmed my resignation... my club is with those of us who did and yet some do-kudos .. what is required to earn  the label, so hard worked for...."
DAVID MARTIN,I have two teenage daughters. We'll be cancelling our subscription.
kevin dretzka,Dr. Tacky married to influence peddler.  Seems like a great pair. 
Kevin Smith,"S trip per married to a criminal for visa. I heard Mel paid $500,000 to him so that he will sign the marriage document to make her visa permanent. That explains why she asked for a nee prenup when she moved into WH. To recoup that past payment "
Jim Walsh,The truth is Jill Biden needs to inflate her resume. It's not her fault liberals are so shallow that they think a rinky dink EdD is the equivalent of being a real doctor. It is not even close.
Kevin Smith,Mel inflated herchest to get more tipsas a s trip per;We all know that
Pat Wirry,"Ok, but calling her Dr. Jill is still a ridiculous."
Kevin Smith,"Seen from the pov of a high school dropout  like patwirrry, all doctorates must feel that way. Trumpers have a huge chip on the shoulder when it comes to anyone with any degree"
Devorah Tucker-Fick,"What was this bizarre jumble of words I just read? Waste of three minutes of my life to read random facts about this strange man. Nothing about Dr. Biden or PhDs. Came off as ignorant and sexist. And his mention of military service was like...why was that there? This former military Captain is confused. And yes, they called me Captain. Because, like Dr. Biden, that was my title. "
Juyong Park,WSJ EB is in a race to the bottom alongside the NYT EB. In the process they are retaining subscriptions of the crazy ones. 
Martha Maroney,"To the individual under discussion:I support your husband and admire you.But ""Dr.""?Pretentious in the extreme. Drop it."
Kevin Smith,"""Yes kiddo """
Frank Basile,"Epstein this takes the cake for Churlishness.That would be Churl with a capital ""C"""
Melissa Angelina,"The opening statement of this piece underscores that it was written solely as  cruel clicbait and highlights everything wrong with men thinking its okay to speak to *any* woman in such a smug condescending manner. Its clear no man with Dr. Bidens credentials would be spoken to in the same tone. As a woman, I'm deeply offended and will be cancelling my digital subscription unless there is an apology or retraction, and I encourage others to do the same. "
Pat Wirry,"As a woman, I realize referring to her as Dr. Jill is ridiculous.  "
Ian G,Not nearly as ridiculous as putting this piece in the opinion pages of the WSJ
ANGIE HINCKLEY,"Let's be consistent: From now on all with  a JD should be called ""Jurists,"" all with an MBA called ""Masters,"" and all with a fine arts degree called ""FADs.""  ;)"
Clay Thomas,"WSJ, Learned a lot about Epstein and the prudence of the Ed. board. Onward.  I am trying to cancel my account. Your website and automated phone services will not process my cancellation. I will call 1-800Journal on Monday morning. "
Scott L,Don't let the virtual electronic door hit on the way out.
Kevin Smith,A physical door will hit trump as he is heading out to prison for life. His s trip per on visa will be shipped back to the eastern european dump she escaped 
Scott L,Highly educated Smith still thinks US citizens need a visa. 
Kevin Smith,a d rif t er married to a g rif t er. She has no citizenship and he is heading to prison.  
Michael Cullers,"The WSJ editorial board continues to plumb the depths to curry favor with Trump's base, which skews decidedly toward those who have never, with the exception of attending a football or basketball game, stepped foot on a college campus.  The editorial board's failure to maintain its standards over the past four years is shameful.  "
Pat Wirry,"Oh, please. Are you familiar with the demographics of the WSJ's subscriber's?  Judge Judy may be a snappy title for a TV show, but calling Joe Biden's wife Dr. Jill is ridiculous. "
Michael Cullers,"Thanks for proving my point, Pat.  What was the score of the last Crimson Tide game?  "
Mark B,"Wow.  While the President of the US does everything possible to destroy our democracy, aided by the gutless Republican leadership, you & the Editorial Board have real concerns about Jill Biden's title.  And believe it's worthy of attention......While sitting back and directly or tacitly supporting the President's arguably treasonous (but inarguably reprehensible) behavior.Thanks for reminding those of us who'd like to protect our basic Democratic institutions & values what we're up against."
Shimer George,"Sorry, I may have multiple posts due to the watchdogs. This pice is pure drivel. The WSJ EB should be ashamed. "
Henry David,"PhD's are greatly overrated, in Education at least its all about a pay raise."
thomas barloon,"Thank you Mr Epstein  (please, do not call me Dr Epstein) and thank to the editorial staff of the Wall Street Journal.  If one wants to learn how not to write about Jill Biden, please read the opinion penned by Mr Epstein. One certainly learns a great cornucopia  of facts about Mr Epstein and one learns little about our next First Lady.  Yes, Mr Epstein was this and Mr Epstein was that and so forth.  Word and words and signifying nothing."
Paul Hillman,"What standards does the WSJ use to select opinion pieces?  I can ignore some 80+ year old white man railing away against  Dr. Biden, but I would think the editors should know better than to publish a piece with virtually no redeeming value but to inflame others, and attempt further long held negative stereotypes.Somebody should lose their job over this one."
EVAN ESCHMEYER,"If  this wasn't so disrespectful it would be comical.   It definitely gives off a whiff of  ""Academic Credential  Napolean Complex"" coming from Mr Epstein.  As someone who happens to have a few degrees from Northwestern, I  think that Steven Colbert and Seth Meyers are definitely deserving of an Honorary NU degree.  And, I hope they add Dr. Jill Biden to their list,  she definitely should come ahead of Mr Epstein."
Dave Abatangelo,I honestly can't express enough my disappointment that The Wall Street Journal would allow the publication of this editorial.It falls so far below the editorial standards of what I would expect that I will be canceling my subscription within a week if the editorial staff doesn't apologize for allowing it to be published.
susan bethanis,"This is an opinion piece, yes; however, the WSJ chose to publish it, which shows a lack of discernment on their part on many levels.  Jill Biden earned her doctorate; if she chooses to use the word Dr. in front of her name, she has earned that, too. I have an Ed.D., and I rarely use Dr. Susan J. Bethanis. Sometimes situations call for it. To the editors: I will be canceling my subscription.  Which is disappointing. I read the WSJ regularly mostly because, generally, it offers a very different perspective from mine; and I like to see various sides of issues in order to come to sound insights and good decisions. However, in all good conscience, I can't support your judgment here publishing this piece. Might I also suggest that to look hard at the feedback you're getting on this and consider issuing an apology.  "
JOANNE NASUTI,"The WSJ continues to lower its standards.  This opinion piece is simple, dull, and overall just too painful to read.  "
Andres Isaza Valencia,"I am a very loyal supporter of WSJ. Love their reporting. But it's 'opinion' articles like this that make me want to cancel my subscription. This is not only ungrounded (she has a doctorate...), but demeaning and sexist. Just because it is an opinion piece doesn't mean you can write whatever you think  - you must back it up and be thoughtful. Can't Mr. Epstein accept that there is a woman who is more successful that he can ever dream of being?"
Mary Loftus,"As the spouse of a humanities PhD and an advanced degree holder myself, I could not agree more. The language and tenor is from another time that, thankfully, we have moved on from. I have been reading for years, but this is the last one I can stomach. Goodbye, WSJ. "
Crawford Crooks,"Ironic to slander a dissertation on community colleges while believing in a political ideology that preaches ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"", as if CCs are not an excellent and cost effective way to do so. If you do not see the value in studying higher education at the doctorate level, as Dr. Biden did, then you are a fool (saying this as a physicist)."
Kevin Smith,"Seeing Mel in her successful s trip pingcareer, it is reported Ivanka will follow in the same footsteps"
Mark Purschwitz,"Mr. Epstein -- and I say ""Mr."" because I don't believe people receiving honorary doctorates should be addressed as ""Dr."" -- your column was ridiculous and condescending.   Do you have too much time on your hands?   Is the WSJ short on essays covering important topics?  Why you would  bring up the topic of honorary doctorates, when the subject of your essay is Jill Biden, is beyond me.   Methinks you protesteth too much, so maybe the topic is of great importance to you.I'm a retired university professor with a PhD who prefers not to use the prefix ""Dr."", although my students did.   Anyone who put in the hard work required to earn any doctoral degree -- PhD, EdD, DrPH, ScD, DD, PharmD, etc. -- has earned the right to be addressed as ""Dr."" should they choose.  If I was talking with one of the thousands of school teachers and administrators who worked their tails off earning an EdD, I would certainly address them as ""Dr.""  How about you, Mr. Epstein?Hats off to you, Dr. Biden."
J Johnston,"When my AC or plumbing fails,  I'm very appreciative of the one that can fix it.  They don't need to be PhD's but I appreciate them.  "
Scott L,"I use a plumber called Dr. Rooter. He deserves the honorific. Dr. Jill, not so much."
Kevin Smith,"Thats because that plumber is a lot more educated than middle school dropout Scott ""L"""
Scott L,Smith considers himself well educated and deserving of a participation trophy doctorate. This despite an inability to write coherently. 
Crystal Houston,Must not have read any of the article. The title is a misnomer and issue a non sequitur as Ms. Biden has earned a doctorate of education degree. The rant is aimed at those who cloak themselves in their honorary doctorate. Using Ms. Biden as his poster girl for bad taste is humorless click bait. And suggesting she should be happy - not for her legitimate achievement but instead to tout her husband's - is a fitting and sexist end to this cheap ploy. 
dan stropes,After the 4+ year diatribe against the Trump family I'm surprised anyone is offended by Mr Epstein's commentary about a Biden family member. 
Scott L,"Hunter has an honorary doctorate in pharmaceutical science, though he lost his title of Ensign USN in the process of getting it."
Kevin Smith,Scott El has a honorary middle school diploma? Probably not. The median Trumper education level is 6th grade.
JESSE SHAPIRO,I can only imagine what Mr. Epstein thinks of the author Dr. Seuss.
Jim Walsh,Dr Seuss taught my kids how to read. His books were entertaining and fun for dad to read with his kids. Jill Biden has not done anything near as beneficial to a child's development.
Kevin Smith,Walsh's kids are now selling themselves for food? Sad
Lissy Gulick,What's your real beef: that a woman has a legitimate doctorate? 
Jim Walsh,"No, it's to provide laughs at the expense of a liberal. She has done nothing worthy of recognition and uses the title to puff up the resume. In the real world, the title of Dr is reserved for MDs. "
Kevin Smith,Middle school dropouts like Walsh and other trumpers do not live in the real world 
Kevin Smith,I wonder if the firsts trip per gets to keep her visa after trump goes to prison
JESSE SHAPIRO,"And they called her visa an ""Einstein visa"".  Imagine getting one without ever graduating from college.  Her escort ""skills"" must have been extraordinary."
Scott L,"Smith thinks US citizens need visas to live in the United States. Unless they're illegal aliens of color, of course."
Kevin Smith,She got a viss with hers trip per job? Or because one of the J0hns sponsored her?
Jason Jimerson,"This seems to be as much about him and his lack of a non-honorary doctorate as about slinging mud at Dr. Biden. What you do is more important than your title. First-Lady Dr. Jill Biden will be just fine. By the way, what makes her title unpromising? Are community college students beyond consideration?This article is a tempest in a teapot, but I wonder why the WSJ would pick those over any other editorial?P.S. what is with this cheap shot? ""rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman."" Go ahead and slander black females too. "
Eric Smith,"Wow.  A breathtaking, perplexing display of snobbery, uncalled for by the facts of Dr. Biden's achievements, from someone who wrote a sophisticated book on snobbery.  Strange in the extreme. "
Jim Walsh,"Those who can do, those who can't teach and get easy to obtain PHDs. "
JESSE SHAPIRO,"Anyone who thinks teaching is easy should be forced to spend a year in a public K-12 classroom.  Of course, I wouldn't want my kid in that classroom."
Kevin Smith,Walsh is another boomer who is take take taking SS and medicare and living on tax payer largesse as most trumpers doMost of them didnot pass high school and dislike teachers with doctorates 
JESSE SHAPIRO,I should have mentioned that I was a corporate executive for 25 years before I became a high school math teacher.  My second career was a lot harder than my first.
Laura Li,"I was a disabled combat veteran when I got my M. Ed. and stepped into the classroom. I echo your thoughts.W Delehunt (USAF, Ret)"
Ellen Rosenfield,"Thank you, Jesse!I am so sick of the anti-teacher attitude expressed by the WSJ and its readers.  Why does Joseph Epstein think he has the right to belittle those who get a doctorate in education?  And why does he make fun of the topic of Jill Biden's  dissertation topic?  Student retention in community colleges is a huge topic, one definitely worthy of study.    His attitude is both sexist and old-fashioned.  "
Jim Walsh,"Only teachers say that. I know a lot of teachers, I wouldn't want my kids in their classrooms. All they do is complain about how hard they work, as if working only 3/4 of year is hard."
JESSE SHAPIRO,"When I taught, I worked 60+ hours per week (no paid overtime, no union).  Many of my students came from very poor, immigrant families.  Most of them have completed college and some are in graduate school.  Almost all in STEM fields. Now I offer free math tutoring to low-income children in my retirement.  "
Kevin Smith,"Thats because Walsh's kids, as he has, dropped out after middle school and have been walking the streets to feed themselves"
Kate Cannon,"Okay, so this is now your sixth post on this story, each more baffling than the last. For example, you have trouble with punctuation. Are you referring to G.B. Shaw's expression, ""Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach""? Commas are very important. And it's PhD, not PHD. I'd love to hear your theory on why you think Jill Biden's PhD was ""easy to obtain"" or why you think she ""can't teach"" since she has been teaching for more than three decades. She will make history as a first lady who will continue her ""day job"" and keep working as a professor at her community college."
ManYee Tsang,"Joseph Epstein has revealed himself to be an unhappy man with too much time on his hands. As a Professor who has  trained many  Ph.D's  in Physics, I celebrate the effort and dedication of people who aspire to and achieve a Ph.D. It takes real dedication to complete a Ph.D., especially if one starts the task ,as Jill Biden did, as a middle aged person. Mr. Epstein clearly could have earned a Ph.D. himself, but like many others he decided not to do so. I am sure that there were practical reasons that drove him to terminate his education. I have known many people who have followed Mr. Epstein's path. It is difficult to survive in the University without a Ph.D. Perhaps that difficulty motivates him to stoop to the level of publicly diminishing the achievement of Jill Biden. He deserves our sympathy."
Anna Brinkmann,"Exactly. I'm stunned that the WSJ published this transparent attack on an accomplished woman. It's so typical, it's boring. Oh look, another old white man denigrating a woman who claims her actual accomplishments in the same way men do. Yawn."
Scott L,"It takes real dedication to complete a Ph.D., especially if one starts the task ,as Jill Biden did, as a middle aged person.I'm sure it does. And were she to complete a Ph.D., particularly in a field like Physics, then she may have some reasonable claim the the honorific ""Doctor"", but with an Ed.D., no."
Mark Purschwitz,"Try telling that to teachers, principals, and other school administrators who have worked their butts off earning an Ed.D.    Same with people who earned a DrPH, ScD, DD, PharmD, or any other non-honorary doctorate.   If you had earned one of these degrees, you would know."
Scott L,"Have them all tell that to a Medical Doctor. If the difficulty and skill were the only criteria a master electrician or plumber or a Bachelor of Physics or Mathematics would be called ""doctor"". "
Nikhil George Charuvilparambil Titus,"There may be a case to not address PhDs as doctors, but why single out Jill Biden ?"
Scott L,Perhaps because she doesn't have a Ph.D. 
Jim Walsh,Because she is the only one who does it outside academia. She hasn't done anything noteworthy so it's an embellishment. 
Jeffrey Hoeber,Seriously considering moving my subscription to the NYT after reading this article. Real shame on WSJ and Epstein.
Kevin Smith,WsJ and the dying from zheimers Ep$ teen cant be shamed. They are beyond shameless
Kevin Smith,GOP party's first l a d y is a $ trip per that did half of Manhattan for 1000 an hour. Not surprisingly  they are reduced to mocking PhDs
Patrick Tyrrell,"And how would you describe your behavior, based on the comments you have provided?"
Kevin Smith, someone needs points out the hypocrisy of people who put a Wh 0000 ker in the WH. Why is that baptists love her? But then again this party loved pants down falwell
Cathy Potter,"Mr. Epstein shows his ignorance of how recently those who practice medicine and surgery obtained the title ""doctor"" and how they did so... as well as  his misogyny,  and prejudice... that the WSJ would print such a piece based on so little knowledge and information, and based on so much ignorance and prejudice,  by a person with rather questionable credentials for even writing such a piece, does not reflect well on the journalistic standards of the WSJ... and ah yes, Mr. Epstein has a  degree in English... obviously not in history... of education, of medicine, or anything else related..."
susan friedland,"Mr. Epstein, you would use the term ""Dr."" if you were smart enough to earn a Ph.D like Dr. Jill Biden did.You're a disgrace and a misogynist.  Why would you call her ""kiddo?"" Are you kidding me? She's an accomplished, professional woman who earned her title out of hard work. You wouldn't address a man this way."
Patrick Tyrrell,"And now, who's the one engaging in childish name-calling & insults?   Your behavior mimics that which you attack.  Such unintended irony!"
Bud Youkers,She doesn't have a PhD; she has an EdD. Big difference.  Problems with reading comprehension perhaps?
Pia Sen,If its a 'doctorate' degree then they get addressed as Dr.Jealous people sometimes call them 'kiddo'. Oh well !
Scott L,How about lawyers with a J.D. (Juris Doctor)? 
Michelle Rose,"This is the most bizarre, condescending, unprofessional, misogynistic,  ""opinion piece"" I have ever read. I am shocked and disgusted that the WSJ would even publish this. I never heard of this author before. I looked him up. He's 83. He's obviously stuck in the 1950's. To call Jill Biden ""kiddo""...... To say that her being called Dr. Jill Biden ""sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic."" Comic?? It's comic that a woman has a doctorate degree?? He makes fun of her Doctorate in Education, calls her Dissertation title ""unpromising"", states that no one should be called ""Dr."" unless they have delivered a child.  And orders her to ""drop the doc"" in her title. And in closing, he suggests that she consider ""stowing"" her title, ""at least in public"" for the next 4 years, and ""forget the small thrill of being Dr. Jill"", and just be happy being First Lady. Mr. Epstein, you are NOT the arbiter of who can and can't call themselves Dr.  Dr. Jill Biden can be First Lady AND a Dr.!!"
Dave Maloney,"I was surprised this trog didn't call her a ""Lady Doctor, not a real doctor."" Maybe he'd settle for First Lady Doctor? "
TED FISK,"This 'opinion' piece is not good. Dr Jill Biden obviously won't listen to the loser who wrote this opinion, but will continue to use her rightful title and I am happy she will. Compared to the FLOTUS now headed for the door, Dr Biden runs countless circles around her. Integrity and respect is returning to the White House with Dr Jill Biden. "
Patrick Tyrrell,"Wow!  Reading all the vitriol below, it is apparent Mr.Epstein really hit a sensitive nerve.    I don't agree with Mr Epstein's opinion on the title in question, but get a grip, people.   This is not an existential threat, only one man's opinion - treat it as such.  But to paraphrase Shakespeare, you doth protest TOO much!   The outrage!  Relax."
Will Vandiver,It seems like those protesting struck a sensitive nerve of yours. 
Pia Sen,"This could be dismissed as tripe from a man with a fragile ego.Unfortunately a prestigious newspaper chose to publish that tripe, giving it a platform and a mic. Mr Epstein is a man of little importance. However, Wall Street Journal is still a neespaper of some relevance. If it wishes to maintain that relevance, then it may need a lesson or two about the price of amplifying sexism and misogyny."
JESSE SHAPIRO,"Let's hear it for American entrepreneurship.  You can now buy a T-shirt that says:  ""That's Dr. Biden to you, Sir.""  All proceeds will go the the NVCC Community College Educational Fund.  That is where Dr. Biden taught when she was the Second Lady."
JAMES M,Hundreds of millions have been sent to the WH billionaire since the election.  What's a few dollars to an educational fund.  
Jim Walsh,Please provide a source for that claim. Be specific. 
ROY FRANK TREMONT," Having worked hard over the last 25 years to keep abreast of Mr.
Epstein's many wonderful essays, books, short stories, book reviews and opinion columns, I'd like to express heartfelt thanks to the WSJ for for keeping his work regularly available to me and an American public desperately in search of a refuge from shabby thought and writing.

For my money,  there is no one currently in the business of writing for educated audiences who has done a better job of producing witty, profound and laugh-out-loud-funny essays on literature, politics, Jews and all other subjects under the sun as expertly and consistently as he has over the years. "
Jeanine Morse,"We have a pandemic we are dealing with, a president who has checked out, a potential retaliatory strike from Iran, etc., etc., and this is what you think is important to write about? what a complete waste of time and opinion column!The Wall Street Journal's integrity is sorely lacking."
David Allon,Surely you have something more profound and consequential to discuss. 
Jim Walsh,"Some don't think it's funny to mock fake claims of intelligence, others, having no sense of humor, try to shut down the discussion. It's called cancel culture. "
SUZANNE SPELL,"This is an ugly, illogical, sexist, and racist piece of writing. Mr Epstein begins by calling Dr Biden ""kiddo"" and dismissing her title as ""fraudulent."" (Yet it is common in academia for those with doctorates to be addressed as ""Dr."")He ends with the condescending advice that Dr Biden should be far more proud of her address - of the mere act of living in the White House - than she should be of her own hard work.Rather than substantiating his arguments,  he fills the bulk of his essay with self-congratulation  and with sloppy attacks on PhDs and honorary degrees, which are two types of degrees utterly irrelevant to Dr Biden's title. He seems to believe that his unsubstantiated claim that PhDs are easy to get means that Dr Biden's EdD is valueless. He dismisses any possibility that honorary degrees granted to black women could be legitimate. I wonder why this paper would publish such an essay, and I certainly regret previously supporting Mr Epstein by buying his books."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Please see my post below-- an abstract of the work Jill Biden did to get her EdD. Then compare that to Mr Epstein's CV- scholarly acheivements, all with just the lowly BA, also posted.Now tell me, which one is a more accomplished scholar?  "
SUZANNE SPELL,"That is irrelevant. The point isn't whether Mr Epstein is accomplished, nor whether Ms Biden's dissertation or coursework is ranked in the top 0.001% of all EdDs in the universe. Mr Epstein didn't base his essay on that at all. He claimed that she was ""fraudulent""solely for using the title of Dr based on having an EdD.Then he added a bunch of grumpy hand-waving about PhDs and honorary degrees. And finally, on his way out, he spat on black women with honorary degrees, and then told Dr Biden to be house-proud, not education proud. That's offensive."
Scott L,"Racist? Is Dr. Jill black? Some other unspecified ""of color""?  Otherwise where did the below non-sequitur come from?He dismisses any possibility that honorary degrees granted to black women could be legitimate. 
 With Ph.D.'s being laughably easy to get these days, the Ed.D. is the even poorer stepchild of a debase academia.  I congratulate Mr. Epstein for having the guts to say what everyone else is thinking. My brother is has 3 science degrees including a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical chemistry from top university. As a research scientist and now a scientific business owner, he confirms that outside of a university setting, and particularly in industry, insistence on use of the honorific ""Doctor"" is seen as  puffery.  Save it for the M.D.'s.  Next we'll have the lawyers with a J.D. (Juris Doctor) telling us to call them Dr."
SUZANNE SPELL,"Here's the racism: Mr Epstein claims that ""Political  correctness has put paid to any true honor an honorary doctorate may once have possessed. If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try 'rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.'"" Further, Dr Biden uses the title because she *is* an academic, so it's disingenuous to attack her for following normal academic practice."
Ruben Kogel,Disgraceful.There are so many urgent things to discuss and the WSJ editorial board choses to give air to a petty grievance.
Linda Smith,"WSJ, this was the most worthy ""opinion"" piece submitted for publication? If so , you have more to be concerned about than if & when Dr. Jill Biden  chooses to use her hard earned credentials."
JESSE SHAPIRO,"When I read this editorial, and its mocking of the Ed. D. degree, I now understand why the Republican Party has come to be led by someone who loves his ""poorly educated voters"".  "
Jim Walsh,"Given that it's the Democratic Party in a corrupt relationship with teachers unions that keep poor and minority kids in failed schools, they rightly deserve to be mocked. Actually given the performance of the schools, they should all be fired. "
Bill Brown,"Pre-Murdoch the WSJ wouldn't have printed this hate piece.  Way to go, Rupert."
F S WOOD,Pre Trump The NY Times would have carried follow up pieces base on the NY Post Hunter Laptop story 
Bill Brown,The common truth in both men is their misogyny.
Jeffrey Hoeber,WSJ which is owned by same company as NY post did not even take up the hunter laptop story
Frank Tong,"Mr. Epstein,Your ignorance in this article rings with tones of irony.The original term of doctor goes back many centuries ago, far before medicine was an established field and back when it was more of a form of quackery (think bloodletting). It referred to religious scholars and then to philosophical and scientific scholars. Universities conferred the first doctorates to those fields. There were PhDs long before there were MDs. Dr. Jill Biden fully qualifies as a doctor. "
Maureen DiRienzo,But the EdD is a new degree invented to give educators who take a lot of coursework and write up a mediocre paper the chance to pass themselves off as accomplished scholars.  
Kevin Smith,If you say so girl
Pia Sen,"I am sure you are very knowledgeable and all, Maureen lassie!"
Jim Walsh,"Pia,So is it ok for liberal to use condescending terms to describe a women? If not Pia owns Ms DiRenzo an apology. Liberals are hypocrites.  "
Douglas Bolger,A new low for Mr. Epstein and the WSJ.  
Calvin Speer,"The first attempt at defending Mr. Epstein was apparently censored, maybe for referring to robots and Democrats in the same sentence.Mr. Epstein tries to address a serious problem at all levels of education in the United States, that is the cheapening of a degree, particularly a college education. College professors who have a doctorate can use Ph.D. on their business cards and nameplates. They can send out Christmas cards with Ph.D. in the signature. But the casual use of ""doctor"" is getting out of hand. This is not a new debate, Most of us can recall similar disagreements as far back as the 70s. There was a time when a medical doctor or veterinarian was given more respect for the effort it took to earn the diploma and maintain a high standard of learning. Not anymore. As for Jill Biden, Ph.D., and other's in the education industry, what have all those doctoral degrees done to help our public school system?"
Maureen DiRienzo,"It's EdD.  And in the hierarachy of doctoral degrees, the EdD is at the bottom.  I posted the abstract of her work for her EdD.  What a joke.  I also posted Mr Epstein's scholarly achievements with only a lowly BA.  He runs circles around her."
Kevin Smith,What did the girl Mo study? Did she pass even middle school? Most trumpers didnot 
JOSE LANUZA,Ms. DiRienzo I suspect Mr. Smith's credentials are just as awe-inspiring as Ms. Biden's.  Which is why he seems to take such great offense at your insight.  
Kevin Smith,"Mr Mal asia.. got fired by a bunch of real banks. Now the community bank of Maha. thir is running Hose like a d 0 g, jumping through hoops. He does nt like to be called Hose though. At least he has a degree, that girl Mo de ran ged is a middle school dropout. Ok then"
Kathleen McCook,"Epstein uses this tactic to get attention. He also trashed Saul Bellow. in the New Criterion. not up to the mark? Then get attention by copying Bellow (who was the user of ""kiddo"" frequently)."
Calvin Speer,Thanks for the correction. 
Ruben Kogel,Hey Calvin - please don't take the COVID vaccine. I hear it's been developed by PhDs masquerading as doctors. Oh and the device you use to comment on this article contain chips designed by Engineering PhDs ALSO MASQUERADING AS DOCTORS. 
Jim Walsh,Interesting. Wanna bet that those PHDs working on Covid are also MDs? Please provide a list of all the computer PHDs using the title of Dr. A PHD in Education is the advanced study of bulletin board decorating. Go look at the course catalogs. That's not even close to what it takes to develop a vaccine. It only happens in academia where they rightly have self esteem issues.
DEREK MOLLIVER,"Dear Mr. Epstein, thank you for pushing me over the edge to finally cancel my subscription to the WSJ. I refuse to support the shoddy editorial standards that allowed this pathetic, misogynistic display of petulance and self-loathing be published. What an embarrassment!"
JOSE LANUZA,"Dear Mr. Molliver,We thank you for your patronage to to this point, and while we would prefer to have you, we doubt we will miss the inability to get past the language that triggers you to see the thoughtfulness used in raising the issue of the devaluation of the doctoral credential.  We believe you know where the exit is.  The door swings back rather quickly - do be careful not to let it surprise you on the posterior."
Caroline Gallagher,"New Flash: when a man calls an accomplished woman ""kiddo"", it may or may not tell you anything about the woman, but it tells you all you need to know about the man.For shame, WSJ.  "
David Anderson,"Seems the ""esteemed"" WSJ has already turned their focused to the bigger issues of whether or not Dr. Jill Biden uses her rightfully owned title instead of talking about the very real tremendous issues in this country. Truly disgraceful I earnestly attempted to read these articles with an open mind, but if this is the type of stuff that will be dispersed I will swiftly look elsewhere. "
JAMES M,"Since Mr Epstein has nothing more pressing in his life than criticizing Mrs. Biden, maybe he could provide proof of why the current first lady came to the US on an Einstein Visa first?  What's her special gift?Why are we so tough on women in general?  That's the real issue here."
Patty Gray,"Mr. Epstein, I cannot tell if you think you are displaying a wry sense of humor, or if you really do have such a clownishly amateur way of building an argument. As someone who earned her PhD in anthropology in the late 1990s, and who has held posts at universities in the U.S. and Europe, I can certainly attest from first hand experience that calling oneself 'Dr.' in the social sciences and humanities is not 'bush league.' But more to the point: your screed is ridiculously sexist, misogynistic and pathetic. Dr. Jill Biden will be laughing over this for years to come, kiddo. WSJ: you should not have allocated a single column inch to this 'drunken uncle' parade of ignorance, and while you should not censor it by removal, you should admit your mortification. "
Lynne Cantwell,"The fact that this 83-year-old fossil felt the need to call our new First Lady ""kiddo"" tells you all you need to know about him.I'm sure his opinion resonates with many old white men who subscribe to the WSJ, though. #timesup"
beverly rogers,"As a female M.D. myself, I have to ask why on earth you felt entitled to even comment on this matter. It is none of your business if Dr. Biden (and that's exactly what she is, just as my brother the PhD is Dr. H___) chooses to use the title she has earned. This is just more rabble-rousing from the Opinion page of the WSJ, which does not deserve its association with an otherwise good newspaper."
Barbara Posadas,"""'A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.'""  Tell that to your psychiatrist, Joseph Epstein."
Corey Luskin,I am embarrassed for both the author and the Journal. It's not even that I disagree with the piece. It's simply that the  piece is nonsense. 
Matthew Zobian,This editorial smacks of personal resentment.  Isn't there something more substantial to write about?
Pia Sen,Apparently an old and insecure man felt threatened by an accomplished and smart woman. It is not an uncommon phenomenon!
JP Sharma,Shame on WSJ for publishing this opinion piece.
Maureen DiRienzo,"Mr Epstein's CV, and all this with only a BA degreeFrom 1972 to 2002, he was a lecturer in English and Writing at Northwestern University and is an Emeritus Lecturer of English there.
He edited The Best American Essays (1993), the Norton Book of Personal Essays (1997), and Literary Genius: 25 Classic Writers Who Define English & American Literature (2007). His work has appeared in The Atlantic, Commentary, Harper's, The New Criterion, The New Republic, The New York Times Book Review, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, and First Things. His short stories were included in The Best American Short Stories 2007 and The Best American Short Stories 2009.[3]
From 1974 to 1998 he served as editor of The American Scholar, the magazine of the Phi Beta Kappa society, and wrote for it under the pseudonym Aristides.But Dr Biden taught high school.... so there's that."
JAMES M,Why do women rarely stand up for each other?
Patrick Tyrrell,Same reason why men rarely stand up for each other.

phidias cinaglia,"...yeah.  There's that... little matter of...  earning an Education Doctorate.  And TEACHING KIDS.  My kids matter to me more than my CV - but if you would like to know - I've helped design the only defensive weapons ever known to shoot down ICBM's (the A.L.L.), I've helped return the Space Shuttle to flight.  And one or two other pretty cool things.  BUT THE SINGLE greatest achievement of my life has been to nurture kids.  I admire her so much for that!"
Laura Li,He was fired from The American Scholar for writing about his homophobia.Add to that his misogyny.W Delehunt
Herbert Abrams, You can call her First Lady of the United States.
F S WOOD,There is that option albeit with an asterisk; perhaps Best Guess FLOTUS
Bailey Koch,"This is infuriating and belittling. Anyone who earns a doctorate should be called ""Dr."" if that is the title they choose. How dare this man call our First Lady, a pinnacle of intelligence who values education for the least fortunate among us ""kiddo."" Mr. Epstein, kindly shut up. "
Stephen DiBitetto,"Thank you WSJ for reminding us that there still are dinosaurs amongst us like Mr. Epstein who should be extinct at this point.   Most of us, if we expressed these views, would be ending our careers.  "
Kathleeen Boehm,"This is WSJ advancing incivility. Their choice as to what ""Opinion"" to post on their pages. That they chose something so asinine, juvenile, condescending, patronizing is all them. No one cares about who or what Epstein is.Today we had trump supporters calling on an end of the Biden administration ""one way or the other"". We had members of the House signing on to try to toss out millions of ballots so their guy could go on four more years. We have McConnell et al afraid to acknowledge much less congratulate our President-elect Biden. All of these things matter greatly. None should be discounted and thought of casually. But that's what the WSJ did today. ""hey kiddo"" in reference to our future First Lady. You lost my subscription and I would hope you lose enough that you look inwards. If this ""Opinion"" is how WSJ wants to be seen - shame shame on you. "
Max E,I thought she was Biden's plastic surgeon.  Or maybe his cosmetic dentist.  A doctorate in education?  Come on man! 
Max E,Jill while working with her then husband on one of Biden's Senate campaigns divorced her husband and married Joe.  Like Hunter's escapades nothing to see here.  
Diana Ross,You really want to go there?  Really?  Come on man.

Bill Brown,"How many wives did Trump cheat on?  Oh, wait -- all 3."
Max E,"Trump is an open book.  Biden a corrupt 40 year corrupt government employee.  I will take Trump, the ultimate outsider and his lovely current wife, Melania, any time.  All we are going to get with Biden is Obama 2.0.  Obama the master of saying and doing nothing.  "
phidias cinaglia,"Fortunately for you, Maxxy... and THANK HEAVEN, for us - your choice will indeed be free, in just a few more weeks!"
Max E,"Mid Terms then TRUMP 2024!  Get ready for the Republican Resist Movement!  We would impeach Joe based on the upcoming Hunter and Joe's brother tax investigation but with hysterical Cali Kamala waiting in the wings I think we will pass.  It's gonna be good watching the Democrats self destruct.  Pelosi, John Kerry, and a host of other Dem lions are going to flop big time.  New York and California can't even run their own states much less the country and that's exactly who runs the Democrat Party.  "
Beth Newsom,"Open, except for his tax returns.  And his grades at Penn.  And his medical problem that led to his emergency trip to the hospital last year.  And the accuracy of  his financial statements.  And his discovery responses to E. Jean Carroll.  And so on.  He is a serial liar and con artist."
George Dodds,I love this.
George Dodds,"I had to write ""I love this"" because I the WSJ wasn't permitting me to even write ""pitiful stuff"". "
Elizabeth Schendel,"It took a misogynist  bashing from a  male  chauvinist to wake us up to the harsh reality that women haters are still the first of the Horrible people that we never want to hear from again.  After four years of Haters, they can all go jump into a lake.   "
Maureen DiRienzo,But... I am a woman and agree with him.  So what does that make me?
Diana Ross,An outlier.  They happen.
Bill Brown,Whatever you want to be.  But probably not a Dr.
Rebecca Adkins,Definitely not a PhD scholar. 
Maureen DiRienzo,"Ah, surprise, surprise, yes, a real biological science PhD, with a massive thesis based on 4 yrs of work in a lab, followed by years as a scientist with a publication record and a patent.  But, Dr Biden taught high school most of her career.  So..."
Alexander Halavais,"As a person who also taught high school, I find your dismissive attitude toward other scholars to be both unkind and unprofessional.Promoting your own career looks pretty sad when you seem not to recognize the capabilities and experiences of others. I absolutely guarantee you that there are those who look down their nose on people who have Ph.D.s but couldn't manage to get a tenure-track job or a significant H-index, with or without a ""massive thesis."" (My thesis, unlike my corpus, was rather tight and lean.) I'm emphatically *not* one of those people. But when scholars try to tear one another down, they tend to bring their own house with them.Let's leave the petty jealousy and anti-intellectualism to the toads, shall we? We should celebrate intellectual achievement, not tear it down."
Rebecca Adkins,"Hmmmm... well if one was going to put EdD at the bottom of the doctoral pile, then I would put have to say that nutrition belongs at the bottom of the biological science pile lol. Those in glass houses should be careful of throwing stones. You wrote elsewhere that ""A doctoral degree is a starting point of what should be a career of achievement in your field."" I'm 58 and currently working on my doctorate in nursing. I guess I'm going to have to work until I'm about 80 if it's just a starting point... or do you think I should just quit? Perhaps I'm just too old to be playing ""doctor"". 

Finally, how impressive is your scholarly scientific PhD work in nutrition for Kellogg Company, The NutraSweet Company, and Monsant?  I can only find 6 published studies in PubMed; however, I am sure you have far more in your 31 years in the field by the way you dismiss Dr. Biden's lack of scholarly work so pretentiously. Can you please direct me to them? Thanks."
Beth Newsom,"This is a truly weird column.  He critizes Dr. Biden for using a title that she earned, by pointing out that (a) the author himself did not earn such title; and (b) lots of people are awarded honorary degrees.  Whatever the author taught at Northwestern, it could not have been logic or persuasion."
Elizabeth Weir,Mr. Epstein has some baggage. Does he feel better now that he has shared his inadequacies? What drivel.
Todd Beuckens,Why is this in the WSJ? This is something Drunk Uncle would say on SNL.
Parvez Asmat,I do not believe that the quality of this piece is high enough to warrant publication. I encourage your editorial staff to thoughtfully consider the feedback it is generating. 
Janet Stulting,"Jealousy ill becomes you, Mr. Epstein.  And shame on you, WSJ, for publishing this.  "
JAY KEEHAN,"What about ""Dr. J. ""? I thought he was great and deserved the title. Am I to think there was something fraudulent about him?"
Margaret O’Neill,"Mr. Epstein,Not sure why you feel the need to mansplain who gets to use the title doctor.  I think that the majority of female physicians in our country are thrilled to have an intelligent, compassionate advocate serving as First Lady.  It's been awhile. Welcome, Dr. Jill Biden. Margaret O'Neill, M.D."
phidias cinaglia,"THANK YOU, Ma'am.  Truly.  Thank you for speaking so eloquently and with such obvious sincerity."
Margaret Duffy,Epstein: A writer of tiny inconsequential books.
Ewurama Appiagyei-Dankah,"Just here to join the hundreds of people calling this piece out for what it is: condescending, sexist drivel. "
Chris Goldschmidt,"Wow, WSJ. You guys used to have standards. What happened? "
Joe Jensen,The Murdock family purchased it!
Jessica Kandel,"As a physician, I recognize the effort and the value that others with doctorates bring to their differing missions.   The title goes with the work.  Dr. Biden has has earned it.  Epstein's thinly veiled resentment of a better-credentialed woman is not only condescending and sexist, but actively bizarre.  WSJ should reinsert him under the rock from whence he crawled.  "
Maureen DiRienzo,"How many scholarly books has Mr Epstein published? Dr Biden?  But let's remember America's awe for a Harvard grad ""Constitutional scholar"" who never published a scholarly piece of work or argued a case before a court.  How easily people are fooled by fancy titles. "
Candace C,"AP News reported Hunter Biden has been subpoenaed on more than 2 dozen entities (companies) and has a separate subpoena for tax fraud in 2014 (not claiming 400,000 in income from Burisma) and the 2.8 karat diamond he received.  This article seems petty and unimportant to me, and Jill Biden is just a diversion. There are many great articles on business, markets, and politics in the WSJ, this one was not so great. "
Ezra Getzler,"I am curious, what your position on President Biden offering his son a pardon, should charges be laid, would be."
David Salzberg,"He must be very jealous of her achievement, which is very real. While I rarely read the opinion pages of the WSJ, this is far beneath the standards I would expect. A personal attach on an accomplished person. Mr. Epstein - should we be in awe of your B.A.?"
jj vecchio,"Mr. Epstein Since Dr. Jill Biden is married to President elect Joe Biden, I assumed that she was a Dr. of Veterinarian Medicine. Thanks for the clarification"
Bill Wildprett,Weak sauce and unfair to veterinarians who do magnificent work
Lexi Butler,"Mr. Epstein, My question for you is: why did you feel the need to write this? It is one thing for you to express what you believe to be the value of a Phd. But even taking your  position as valid (which I do not believe it is), it is unclear, however, why Dr. Biden was included in the piece. Your point could have been made without belittling her, calling her ""kiddo,"" questioning her intelligence. Ultimately, your advice to Dr. Biden is the following: drop the title of ""Dr."" because you have now have a ""better"" one as First Lady. At the end of the day, this is sexism loud and clear. Unfortunately, this piece does not add to the conversation nor does it introduce any new or inspired ideas. Rather, it simply amplifies an old, tired and outdated refrain that a woman's place is by her husband's side. A disappointment from the WSJ."
Constantinos Scaros,"A few people have pointed out that Epstein  - and I join you in disagreeing with him - is being sexist. Maybe so, but I think it's more of a case of a guy who never got a doctorate and makes himself feel better about downplaying its value. I voted for Trump - but I think Jill Biden has earned the right to call herself Dr. ! "
Lexi Butler,But he could have made a blanket statement about PhDs without bringing her into the conversation. Or he could have referred to a man with a Phd. But he did not. 
Alexander Halavais,"Had he failed to include Dr. Biden, this never would have made it to the opinion page. Say what you will about Mr. Epstein's obvious lack of decorum or insight--he knows from clickbait."
Louis del Valle,I would have thought that with Trump electoral and legal demise the Wall Street Journal would have begun to wean itself from Trumpism. 
Constantinos Scaros,"Oh, they've already weaned themselves from Trumpism by joining the rest of the media malpractitioners and calling Joe Biden ""president-elect' before the electors elected him or Trump conceded, which they DIDN'T do in 2000 with Bush-Gore. Nonetheless, I absolutely agree that Jill Biden has every right to call herself Dr., and if she wants to do so, she should! "
Diana Ross,Don't demean yourself with such silly talk.  He is clearly president-elect indeed as finally acknowledged by the GSA.  That is the way it has always been and in the face of zero evidence on tampering that is the way it is going to stay 'til his inauguration.  It's time to accept the democratic will of the people.  If you can't be gracious about it I suggest you don't say anything.
DIANE MCCLURE,"I received my PhD in Cardio-respiratory physiology.  I then went to Professional school.  When I graduated, I listed the degrees in the order I received them and was promptly corrected.  The PhD is the higher degree and it should follow the professional degree (MD, DDS, DVM).  The PhD was absolutely more challenging than the medical degree.  I am now participating in Educational Scholarship after decades training medical professionals and participating in medical research.  It is not as easy as it looks. Mr. Epstein's ignorance should never have been amplified by the WSJ.  I am disappointed in this cheap shot at Dr. Biden."
Rod Peterson,This is an outrage.  I have an MD and a JD.  Jill Biden should shout her credentials to the rooftops.  Credentials are everything.  Every woman needs everything she can wield in this male dominated sexist WSJ culture.  Uneducated men need to be as insecure as they can be.  They have had their feet on our necks for all of history.  Now is the time for us to wield our own power with education and knowledge. This man just recognizes that Dr. is a powerful moniker. Good on Dr. Biden!
LILBURN T,"It's interesting that ""Dr"" Epstein feelsIt appropriate to refer to his honorary doctorate but he didn't say where it's from - noDoubt because if there is any justice, that institution would rescind his degree quicker than you could say ""Stephen Colbert""!"
Steve Low,"First time I've made a comment on a WSJ opinion piece - the author is a amazingly condescending and wrong-headed (I've avoided other words that I truly want to use here).  The fact that he either just doesn't like anyone named Biden or is jealous of a person who actually got a degree is unclear.  He shouldn't be ashamed of what he did not accomplish but what he did accomplish - if he taught hundreds of students and helped them along the way attain their goals should be lauded.   The fact that Dr. Biden worked hard to attain the degree, has been teaching at a community college and wants to continue to do so should be admired, lauded and copied.  We should all do our best help others trying to attain their goals in life.  We are part of a broader community - please be a support, a cheerleader and admirer of all who try to teach others (these are first line workers!)  "
Constantinos Scaros,"I think he's jealous of her degree. Actually, he's helped me because I find her dissertation topic tremendously interesting, and I'm going to read it. "
Mickey Spillane,I guess Epstein prefers a First Lady with naked photos on the Internet.  I for one will find Dr. Biden a refreshing change.
Maureen DiRienzo,"Jill Biden did some modeling too, if you had done some research you would have discovered that.  "
Kit Lancaster,"I'm curious how this article creates value for me as a reader, or anyone else reading?  The only takeaway here is pure disappointment.  This is the best; you could offer today, really?  Wow?  If I wanted to read offensive, unconstructive garbage like this I wouldn't pay for professional material to be delivered to me online / at my door.  Stop wasting our time and space with such a useless article that makes me questions basic values of the organization as a whole.  Your move WSJ.  What are you going to do now?  Keep digging or put the shovel down?  

"
Elizabeth Schendel,Wall Street journal on par with National Enquirer. 
Constantinos Scaros,"I voted for Trump. I hold two doctorates. Neither is in medicine. I worked hard for both of them. I call myself ""doctor"" sometimes, other times not. Jill Biden ABSOLUTELY has earned the right to call herself Dr. if she so chooses. It seems Mr. Epstein is one of those who never reached the grapes high on the doctoral vine and has deemed them sour. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"It is one thing to have done some (rather mediocre) work to be awarded a EdD.  It is another to go around flaunting it. For most of her career, Jill taught high school, which is fine.  Then she went back to school and got an EdD.  So where are her scholarly publications, her books?  A doctoral degree is a starting point of what should be a career of achievement in your field.  Does she have any?  Personally as a woman with a scientific PhD and a career in science, who doesn't do around calling myself Dr DiRienzo, Mrs Biden looks like she is compensating by using the Dr title.  Bad look."
Durgasharan Krishnamurthy,Did she earn her doctorate or not?  No body is disputing that she earned her doctorate in education. Once she has earned it she has the right to use the honorific title regardless of what happened thereafter. Please be more generous towards fellow human beings. I think it was Victor Hugo who said that Intellect without love and compassion becomes petty.
Margaret Duffy,"Maureen, I'd love to read your books. Could you send links? Thanks."
JENNIFER LEWIS,"False.  Anyone who has earned an EdD can use the title ""Dr."" regardless of publications after the dissertation. The lady doth protest too much, methinks. You have a lot of posts on this article-- and most of your claims are wrong, petty and vindictive.  Something here is way overdetermined for Dr. DrRienzo. Enough!"
Sarah Michaels,"Sexism, I think so. First, I am a 4th year doctorate student in my 50s. I am a devoted music educator, and have been for 21 years.  Studying to get my doctorate degree at Boston University has made me an exceptional teacher to all of my beloved students .  I am so grateful that I took the plunge and decided to keep learning; keep growing for my music students.  How dare you ask Dr. Jill Biden,  to ""drop the Dr."" just because she ""doesn't deliver babies"". Are you kidding me?
May I stand up for our future First Lady and all women and and say, ""Shame on you for disrespecting women who have chosen to advance their education. Also, don't compare an honorary doctorate degree to the 15 years of hard work that Dr. Biden devoted to earning her doctorate. I must ask,""Why are you so sexist?"" At 83, are you so ""behind the times"" that you can not fathom that women will educate, advance, and yes, govern in 2020?  No longer, Mr. ""I barely earned my B.A. degree."" Just tired of the misogyny.
"
Maureen DiRienzo,"Jill Biden spent most of her years teaching high school, then did a mediocre study (see below) to get a EdD.  Now we are to genuflect to Dr Biden.  Gimme a break.  To all the women who spent years in a lab, published real research and wrote books, but don't go around calling themselves Dr, she is a real joke.  "
Diana Ross,"Well I spent years in the lab and published research.  Didn't write a book but the thesis was a tome.  And she has a PhD and can call herself doctor if she likes.  What made you so  bitter and sour that you find that hard to accept?  And who made you the doorkeeper pray?  My Chemistry teacher at high school had a doctorate and we always called her Dr Douglas.  And that was correct.  She spurred me on to get my own doctorate.  I'm sure many of Dr Biden's charges have gone on to get doctorates too.  Again, why so bitter?"
John Harris,"Eventually, somebody in the White House faints, fall to the floor.... Instinctively, perhaps  a call for Dr. Jill, and then wasted valuable brain -draining seconds ... with the obligatory clarification?The White House has almost always had an MD White House Physician.  (... a 60 yrs active surgeon)"
Maureen DiRienzo,"This Executive Position Paper (EPP) studies student retention in the community college and Delaware Technical & Community College in particular. The paper focuses on four areas of students' needs: academic, psychological, social, and physical. An overview of the paper is given, and an introduction to Delaware Technical & Community College is presented. First, the nature of the pre-tech (developmental) population is discussed. Then, a literature review offers current research by experts in the field. In addition, the results from pre-tech students, faculty, and advisor surveys and interviews are analyzed. Statistical information underscores the problem of retaining students, and personal accounts from students provide insight as to why students drop out. Overall, problem areas are identified, and recommendations and solutions are offered and encouraged.Jill Biden's EdD thesis.   Surveys, personal accounts equal doctoral work?  Not in my world. "
Margaret Duffy,"Could you provide links, Maureen, to your peer reviewed publications and books? Would love to read."
Tom Geurts,"Maureen DiRienzo, PhD earned her degree in Nutrition from the University of Minnesota in 1985. Her latest co-authored research is on ""Cooked Oatmeal Consumption"". Source: Researchgate. "
Michael Maslakowski,"As an almost 6 year subscriber to this paper, this is the single most disappointing article I have ever read. Regardless of this being about Dr. Biden, The fact the author has no legitimate PhD or equivalent yet speaks in a tone as if they are familiar with the personal commitments of a PhD through no experience and was permitted to be published in the WSJ, wich I revere as the most creditable news agency."
Elijah Gunther,I think your mistake here was considering the WSJ a creditable news agency
Christina Rodriguez,"My daughter was required to pay this subscription for WSJ at the University Of Miami while she worked on her master's degree,  after reading this I'm glad she won't be pursuing a Ph. D now that I will be canceling the $9.99/month.Signed the daughter of a Ph.D in Philosophy and Letters earned in 1942 in two foreign languages.cc U.M."
John Bezirganian,How do you get the 9.99 a month rate?  
Christina Rodriguez,"You must be enrolled as a full time student and then it continues as an alumni after graduation for a couple of years.  It is a student rate offered to universities, but after this article that affects future enrollment towards a Ph.D, that rate may need to be reduced for universities to still require it?"
Charlie Hurd,WSJ opinion page reaches a new low. This is really worth publishing. Good grief. 
David Segal,"Funny, but I have a juris doctoris (JD) degree from Temple University School of Law (Class of '69).  I am quite entitled to call myself Dr David Segal, although I choose not to use the honorific in  ordinary cases.  In fact, the only time I ever referred to my doctorate was in East Berlin in the 1980s, where ""Herr Doktor Segal"" carried valuable cachet than it did in the US. The title never signified medical credentials, except to the uninformed.  Is your criticism of Dr Biden's use to the title a question of envy or serious academic  interest?"
Kate Shevlin,"You are so on target.  An Ed.D. is a joke, it is common for teachers to keep taking courses for pay increases especially union teachers, they accumulate enough credits to get paid the equivalent of an Ed.D.  Teachers with Ed.D's should be addressed as Dr. in the classroom but not outside.  I last worked for a principle who had a ""group Ed.D"" from a mediocre school and was extremely incompetent, couldn't speak or write without error, drove a real PhD on faculty crazy.  Jill Biden never taught full time while she was pursuing degrees; she was married to a US senator and had perks way beyond most educators.  I was an adjunct at 3 different universities and concluded it was slave labor.  BTW, I'm a retired private school teacher."
Pierre David,"@ Kate Shevlin. You may be a ""retired private school teacher,"" but the fact that you cannot spell principal leads me to consider that maybe, just maybe, you should refrain from criticizing people who make errors. "
kathi littmann,Petty piece that reflects more on the author's limitations than any factful research and analysis on the content & quality of Dr. Biden's work.  Weak premise to begin with.  Missed the opportunity to argue for increased quality & prestige of advanced education sector degrees.
Ashvin Pande,A new low for wsj editorial page.  And that's saying a lot after 4 yrs of having to get in line behind Trump.  
Tiffany Lashay,"Another debacle by an old white man. Is it true that old white men suffer from an inferior complexity more than any other group? That they perhaps pass it down to their white male children? Is that why they voted for trump who plays the tough guy on TV? Why do you men feel so inadequate next to women? The world has seen Melania, ""the first lady"" naked but you want to take the time to be condescending to Dr. Jill Biden??? I suppose this is perfectly logical in the illogically world of trump. Save this piece of gibber for the planet that you all live on."
Constantinos Scaros,"Good grief!  Why must EVERYTHING be about Trump?  I agree that Jill Biden should absolutely call herself ""Doctor"" if she so chooses, as she has earned that right. Personally, I hold TWO doctorates, and neither is in medicine, and I DO call myself doctor on some occasions, and not on others. Melania, by the way, who speaks five languages, is also a highly intelligent woman, much like Mrs. Biden. Trump has NOTHING to do with this op-ed piece,  with which both you and I find fault. "
Vivienne Hsu,"Mr. Epstein is a sour, ignorant fool who is entitled to his opinion. I am sure Dr Jill Biden, having earned her doctorate, welcomes differing view points and is not threatened by an opinion piece in WSJ."
Maureen DiRienzo,"How many scholarly books has ""Dr Biden"" authored vs ""Mr Epstein""?  "
Chaz Miller,So much for editorial standards at the Journal.  
Peter Batjer,I would call this a cheap shot by an envious editorial writer. We can do better than be a small person like that.
sebastian duchene,"Mr. Epstein, Why are honorary degrees and actual PhD/EdDs being equated in this piece? Sure, you can believe honorary titles are given out far too generously. Many of your readers today will certainly think so of yours. But that in no way provides any evidence for the actual experience of PhD/EdDs who spend 4-6+ years of grueling work to earn their titles.Addressing professors by their first names and having defenses be deeply meaningful moments of intellectual exchange, without making a candidate faint, are positive developments as we move away from the toxic and inflexible hierarchies academic institutions used to be. That change does not have to come at the cost of the rigor of the research. I am sorry for your experiences that suggested otherwise.  

Furthermore, your insults of Dr. Biden concerning her dissertation title and referring to a 69 year-old woman as ""kiddo"" add nothing to your argument, though they are suggestive of your character. I think you owe her an apology. "
Hayden Kajercline,"Well said, Sebastian!"
Karen Goodman,"Having taught in higher education for 40 years, I do not have a problem with this opinion page. Mr Epstein's sentiment that ""The Ph.D. may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards in university education generally, at any rate outside the sciences."" is, in my experience, true. Dr Biden's Ed.D degree was 54 credits and is projected to take 3-4 years part-time. The term limit to complete the degree is, according to the University of Delaware, no more than 5 consecutive semesters. How did it take her 15 years? Who helped her get such an extension ?  I'm sorry; the whole ""Dr. Biden"" strikes me as pretentious. Similarly I have many colleagues in my own field who have completed less than rigorous degrees and delight in calling themselves Dr. "
Durgasharan Krishnamurthy,"Ironic. A honorary doctorate demeaning a person who has earned her doctorate. By the way look at the manner in which the author inserts references to his honorary doctorate and people calling him Dr so many times.I recently subscribed to WSJ thinking that it was a serious paper with some depth. These kind of articles belong to tabloids. This probably the effect of Trump on the editors of WSJ.Durgasharan, India"
Tiffany Lashay,"The WSJ is owned by Murdoch, THE KING OF TABLOIDS. He became a billionaire by selling fantasies to the gullible. "
Edward Nunez,"Somehow, your comment explains why the WSJ has been so generous to Trump.  Murdoch and Trump are birds of a feather....It all makes sense. "
Alberto Battaglino,"How wrong you are Mr Epstein! First of all that point only people that delivers a child should be called Dr, what a joke!  what about all the Phd people that created covid Vaccine? what about all Phd in arts? aren't they worthy enough for you? I wonder what degree do you have? If you have a Phd you should/would know how hard it is to obtain one. "
Joshua Hernsberger,Is it possible that the writer went to see a medical doctor and somehow ended up in a classroom? Or a research lab? Or a dentist chair? Or a Veterinarian? Kiddo we've all been there. It can be confusing to differentiate between different types of doctors. My advice is next time you have a doctor's appointment call the office to make sure you're seeing the right kind of doctor.
Erica Brand,"I've also been called Dr many times because occasionally in academic settings people assume I have a PhD, which I don't, so I also correct them.   All that demonstrates is it is very common to address holders of the PhD as Doctor.    Since Jill Biden did complete a dissertation, Epstein actually shows that Dr Biden can legitimately be addressed as Doctor.  Apparently Epstein has an ax to grind about the irrelevant honorary degrees, and probably he has a lot of latent insecurity.   What a pointless and self-contradicting piece this was. "
CW L,Q.  [stage direction -- panicked voice] Is there a doctor in the house ?A.  Don't look at me . . . A.2.   [stage direction -- rolling up sleeve and palpitating patient]  What is nature of your medical emergency ?
Polly Morrice,"I for one am thrilled that Dr Jill Biden studied  the needs of community college students and is dedicated to teaching them.  Millions upon millions of American students attend these institutions. These should be as good as we can possibly make them -- providing a great, reasonably priced  start for those planning to go on to four-year degrees, and providing deeply useful certificates and training in fields that will lead to well-paying jobs. Three cheers for Dr. Biden! "
Ram Mohan,"What a thoroughly disappointing OpEd piece. What's fraudulent about an honestly earned degree that confers on its recipient the appropriate honorific? This is reminiscent of attempts in prior centuries to deny women who had earned MDs the honorific Doctor (newspapers would call them Doctoress). Shame on the WSJ to publish this opinion, especially coming from someone without equivalent educational qualifications."
William Campbell,I will be delighted to call her Doctor when I call Don the Don ex-president.  She fights for education while he has demeaned everyone who doesn't bow and scrape his current pronouncements and lies. 
Matthew Porter,Just set myself a reminder for 7am on Monday. Can't wait to call and cancel my subscription. I can't believe the  WSJ is wasting space on this nonsense. 
Stephanie Hataway,"Epstein really tips his hand here when he criticizes Dr. Biden's dissertation, and takes a jab at community colleges which perform a very valuable service to a wide variety of students. Kudos to Biden for retaining the job that she is passionate about and boosting education in the process. She will be a great advocate for educators and our military. Meanwhile, #bebest, Epstein."
BHARAT RAO,"""Mr"" Epstein - not clear what your problem is. Whether someone wants to use their title, that they've earned, is upto them. Your take on how and whether those titles have depreciated is your take. Keep it to yourself. Why did this article see the light of day? "
Stephen Ryan,"And then there's Dr. Henry Kissinger, who, as the story goes, delivered quintuplets on a secret mission to Saigon!"
Kyle Harvey,"This article could only be written by a man without an advanced degree. Oh, wow-that's the author!"
Elizabeth Kelly,"So,  I cancelled my WSJ subscription today because of this petty article during a pandemic when we are losing so many precious lives. Like Dr. Biden, I worked my way through graduate school.  It was arduous work in the evenings from 8 to midnight every evening,  but I loved every moment. I am proud of my hard work, and I'm proud of all the other working men and women out there who study at night in pursuit of deeper, more meaningful education.  It made me a more empathetic person; I highly recommend the author go back to school as well. "
M. Evans,"Fun! More pieces like this, please. After all the silliness unleashed on Trump (he had two pieces of chocolate cake!!) turnabout is fair play!"
Philip Han,"Wow.  Really?  With all the problems in today's society and world, this is what the wsj prints?  Really?  A lame hit job?  Truly disgusted...."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Dear ""dr"" Biden, doctor of education--EdDReal PhDs don't feel it is necessary to use their title anywhere other than the work environment.  Using it in the public leads uninformed people to believe you are a physician, which you are not.  Mrs DiRienzo (who BTW has a biological science PhD). "
Margaret Duffy,"I have a ""real"" PHD and rarely use the honorific. Nevertheless, Dr. Biden has every right to use the title. This is a mean spirited hit job by a not-too-bright guy."
Roy Binder,Dr diRenzoYour credentials have earned you the right to be addressed however you wish.  I saw you have made a number of posts so I thought it important to recognize you. 
Steven Kaufman,"She has every right to use the title because she earned her Ph.D.  Some people use the doctor title, and some don't. Who cares? It is good to have a well educated person and a working teacher in the White House. Is this column really worthy of the WSJ?"
Maureen DiRienzo,"She has a EdD.  To those of us with PhDs, this is a lesser degree.  I spent four years in a research lab and wrote a two volume thesis.  Whatever she did, doesn't come close.  Probably worth a MA is my world.  "
Margaret Duffy,"Gee Maureen, that doesn't sound like a well-evidenced judgment since you haven't read her work. Did you actually do any real research? "
Maureen DiRienzo,"See above, her thesis abstract-- Surveys? Gathering opinions constitutes doctoral work? Yeah, for the lofty EdD degree.  "
Susan Murphy,"Gathering survey data does constitute doctoral work. Advanced statistical modelling often goes along with it. But you collecting a few lab samples and doing a baby t-test is ""real"" science. "
Sundar Viswam,"Maybe it is pretentious of Dr. Biden to use the 'Dr.', maybe she got her PhD from an unreputed institution with an ordinary thesis topic, I don't know. What I do know is this is one of the meanest, pettiest and most vicious hatchet job on a person who really has been doing useful if unglamorous work quietly and diligently for many years. The hate, bile and venom of this frustrated chauvinist is sickening."
John Newton,"That's Dr. Biden to you, Bachelor's degree. Your ignorance does not excuse your failure to appreciate that she earned her degree and the recognition that degree confers. Your claim that the stature and significance of a doctoral degree has been diminished by falling standards does nothing but denigrate the only degree you have. Imagine the base qualifications of a lowly college graduate-if that is what you are-if Universities grant masters and doctorates to anyone who joins the queue."
Bruce Greer,"May I suggest you take a read of the Quanta Magazine whose articles are full of references to and quotes from scientists with Ph.D's. Just looked at one that quoted Richard Feynman, not Dr Richard Feynman, but Richard Feynman. I suppose, in all fairness it should have been Nobel Laureate Dr Richard Feynman. I suppose Whoopi Goldberg should be excused for thinking what a great Surgeon General Dr Jill Biden would make."
JENNIFER LEWIS,"I've always wondered how someone who teaches at the University of Chicago could write such drivel for the Wall Street Journal. Today *Mr.* Epstein showed his cards. It's not too late, Mr. Epstein! Doctoral work might help you examine your assumptions, make claims based in evidence, and consider issues from multiple perspectives. You might be exposed to new ideas like respect for women. Perhaps you'd learn enough to drop your tawdry dismissal of institutions and structures you demean here, like the University of Delaware, an EdD, and the serious challenges of educating community college students.  In the meantime, I hope the editorial board will maintain some quality control. This column does not add luster to your publication.   --Jennifer Lewis, PhD (conferred by the University of Michigan, okay?)"
Marilyn Walsh,"Well said, Dr. Lewis , explaining to Mr. Lewis how it works...."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Name some books "" Dr Biden"" has published."
Margaret Duffy,"Name some books ""Dr. DiRienzo"" has published."
Kate Koppenhoefer,"Maureen, you are absolutely correct that it's within your right to decide not to be called Dr.  But that doesn't mean you get to decide that what's right for you is right for everyone.  She worked for and was given the title because she received a doctorate.  Why is it important for you to dimish that? Why do you get to decide that because you dont' want to use your doctor title, nobody else can either? "
Dimitris Papanikolaou,glad to see we are focusing on important topics. 
Ellen Heltzel,"I must defend Mr. (not Dr.!) Epstein. Over the years I have practically made him a member of our family by  quoting his essays or delivering them to unsuspecting relations by email. His takedowns of American culture are both funny and perceptive. In this case, he's on firm ground:  For purposes of clarity, the Associated Press stylebook used to and maybe still does dictate that only medical doctors get the title. Seems reasonable to me. "
Katy Chung,Oh for heaven's sake.  This is not semantics. He is absolutely belittling and sexist in his tone and his purpose is to undermine her degree. 
Kevin Smith,"there are at least 10,000 guys that can claim to know Mel thes trip per in a biblical sense. ANd her glossy spreads are available with a search click. "
Kate Koppenhoefer,"Regardless of whether you believe that only medical doctors should call themselves doctor, or else they are elitist, I hope we can all agree that calling any woman ""kiddo"" is demeaning.  I'm sure the follow comment that is forthcoming is to tell all us ladies to ""lighten up"" or ""take a joke."" "
Christopher Morgan,"I am a man who has been called ""kiddo"" at times.  The term has nothing to do with gender and is only demeaning if you have a very thin skin."
Kevin Smith,if you say so b-0-y
Kate Koppenhoefer,"It has to do with gender when a man saying it to a woman to take her down a peg, which is precisely the situation her.    It's demeaning whether or not you have a very thin skin.  Even if Dr. Biden read that comment and laughed it off and didn't think twice about it (i.e. exhibited a thick skin), it would  still be demeaning. "
Sharon Stout,"""The term has nothing to do with gender and is only demeaning if you have a very thin skin.""The term has everything to do with disrespect and is only demeaning if you apply it to another sentient being.   FIFY.  Sample sentence for you:  ""Then I said to myself, 'Kiddo, you're got to be kidding' --  but I couldn't tell whether I was really paying attention or just trying to pretend  to be linterested.""   "
Kevin Smith,WSJ prefers them  to bes trippers that charged  $1000 an hour for specific salacious services as a certain slovenian woman has done for 10 years before she married a criminal for visa
James Mathis,"The self-deprecating humor of  Mr. Epstein (who I'm happy to call Dr. if he would secretly prefer it), cannot fully disguise the fact that this piece is simply catty jealousy unleashed for who knows what purpose."
Colin Wilson,"Very disappointing editorial choice to elevate this ignorant, misogynistic, senile rant.   You owe Dr. Jill Biden and every other Ph.D. in the country an apology for publishing this.   These are earned honors, not equivalent to honorary degrees.  It further dilutes your reputation by association.   I will not be renewing my subscription if this is the level of writing that WSJ considers appropriate for the opinion page.The editor that chose this content should be fired for incompetence."
Nate Falkner,100%
Bruce Greer,She ain't a Ph. D. There is a decided difference between a Ph D in astrophysics and an Ed D. (And an even greater difference between a Ph D in studies of any kind and a Ph D in any part of STEM.)
Maureen DiRienzo,"Not this PhD.  I totally agree.  EdD is a low level degree, and for Mrs Biden to use the Dr title is elevating herself, even passing herself off as a physician."
Margaret Duffy,"Again, what books have you published ""Dr. DiRienzo?"""
Susan Murphy,"She is a bitter, bitter person here. I wonder how unqualified she is bringing down everyone else's degree. Thank goodness she isn't around when my students call me Dr. "
LILBURN T,Wow.  What sentient being on the EB would have decided this was worth space on a periodical that people actually pay their hard earned money for? A new low for the EB.
GREG SMITH,To borrow  from Jay-Z - we got 99 problems and this ain't one of them.   Of all the dumb things to worry about with all of the issues we have right now.
Scott Johns,"This is, without doubt, the dumbest essay I have every ready in the WSJ.First, I didnt vote for Joe Biden.Second, anybody that has worked hard and obtained a doctorate degree, has my respect (no matter what subject the degree is held in).Lastly, out of basic professional respect, anyone that has earned a doctorate degree is correctly addressed as Doctor (insert last name here).Epstein is wrong! "
John McCree,"This awkwardly written editorial seems dismissive towards disciplined study in an area of career focus, as if credentials and qualifications mean nothing to WSJ in the post-Trumpian era?  Or is this just a random dig at community colleges?  Or honorary degrees?  Or inclusiveness in education?  Or the Bidens in particular?  Regardless, Dr. Jill Biden's lifetime of accomplishments and commitment to important causes deserves respect.  Perhaps it's time to begin more thoughtful dialogue on education, healthcare, military service, ethics and the rule of law."
Lisa Jenkins,I don't know if I'm more appalled that this article was written by this small-minded man or that it was published by what should be a reputable periodical.  The only thing I am sure of is the cancellation of my WSJ subscription. 
David Kraus,"WSJ opinion page is, and always has been, a joke, publishing partisan hack work at the expense of thoughtful commentary.If this wasn't 2020, i would suggest thus is  an outrageous, pathetic piece of small minded idiocy.  Unfortunately,  given this year's events ... it just means it's on brand.Sad."
Christy Nielsen,"I have a Doctor of Pharmacy. My official title is Dr.  This article is offensive in the extreme. With all that is going on in the world, this what this man chooses to write about? Ridiculous. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"And at your work, it is fine to be addressed as ""doctor"".  But when you are outside of your work environment, do you use the Dr title?  I think doing so is bourgeois and pompous.  And deceptive, since many will assume she is a physician.  "
Jim Walsh,"I don't care who has a PHD in Education. Given the performance of the public school systems across there country, all of them should be embarrassed about the quality of their product, the product they learned in these programs. "
Celia Winkler,"Epstein argues that doctorates have been devalued in large part because universities no longer require proficiency in Latin and Greek . Such a requirement would serve solely as a gatekeeping device, to keep us dirt farmers out of the higher levels of academe. Letting in the lower orders is one of the reasons that university education has been devalued by the ruling classes--PhD programs let in all sorts of riffraff, like women, people who graduated from state colleges, and people of color. It was okay when they let in a few very special specimens (nice to have a token) but when academic departments started being chaired by such vermin, that was too much. It is always thus. The moment the hoi polloi (hey, Honorary Doctor Epstein, I used Greek!) move into an area formerly reserved to white upper class men,  it loses prestige and power.
And esteemed gentlemen like Mr. Epstein are affronted when they dare to hold onto the title they earned with so much work, pain, and poverty. "
robert whalen,Thank you Dr. Woke.
Sharon Stout,"""...move into an area formerly reserved to white upper class men...""   Right.    Before Title IX was passed in 1972, many schools and programs simply did not admit women.   It is still true that the dullest high- income applicants are more likely to go to college that the brightest low-income ones.   I don't know why we squander talent.   Or why some people are invested in denigrating and hazing others.   Does it add anything to their stature?  No.   "
Chuck Eddy,Dr. Jill Biden is a legitimate Doctor of Education. Your suggestion is ridiculous.. 
Thomas Erb,And will probably hurt education in the USI bet opportunity scholarships  in DC will be cut first.And yes I'm happy Biden won.
Gerald Wunsch,A guy with a chip on his shoulder. Petty sad stuff.
Jim Walsh,"There are likely millions who are not impressed with PHD's calling themselves doctors in a nonmedical field.  A lot would consider it a attempt to steal the reputation of those who earned an MD. Compare the two fields of study, there is a reason that educations  majors tend to have higher GPA's and its not intelligence. "
PATTI HANSEN,"The use of doctor by Jill Biden outside of the college setting is pretentious and elistist.  The article echos what I have been thinking about her for some time.  Of course there's been a huge backlash because nobody is allowed to express an opinion anymore, let alone an opinion about a woman.  Get a grip people."
Micah Maziar,"OK, kiddo. People can express their opinions just fine. They just can't handle when they get called out for a bad one."
Laura Hamburg,"We can be certain that unlike the current occupant of the White House,  Joe and Jill Biden will rise above and not Tweet about this asinine, insulting, self-aggrandizing opinion. The President-elect and First Lady-elect know they have a country to heal,  metaphorically and actually. Millions of people are sick, hundreds of thousands have died, and tens of millions are out of work. They don't have the time nor inclination to worry about stupid, insecure pundits who have nothing better to do than manufacture issues for the sake of seeing their name in print.  "
Kevin Smith,"What a bunch of losers, trump and his base.Most of them have not even high school education. He said ""I love my uneducated and stupid base and they love me back"" He had to pay someone to take his SAT.Apparently it is not known to these fools that Ph.D. and Ed.D. holders have been using the doctor salutation for decades. According to these fools, all Univ professors should stop being called Dr. "
Kevin Smith,"None of this matters anyway, as the criminal that killed 300,000 Americans was heading to prison for his numerous crimes. But he added sedition and treason to his list of crimes. Those two carry a stiffer sentence than mere life in prison.If he appeals to Dr. Biden, she might convince her husband Pres Biden to commute the criminal sentence back to Life in Prison"
Thomas Erb,The only people I call doctor are MDs.College PhDs are called professor.My friend who  was a PhD physicist on the Manhattan project I called Mr.
Christy Nielsen,Not all of us with doctorates work in academia. 
Susan Murphy,"Gosh you seem to be the head of the world of titles. Everyone at my university who is not yet full professor across social, physical, natural sciences are called...wait for it...Doctor.  "
Matthew Beckman,"Joe,  thank you for reminding me that I forgot to cancel my subscription to the WSJ after the free trial ended.  Also, this is a load of misogynistic tripe you've written.  I earned a Ph.D. and teach undergraduate science students. I encourage them to always address those with advanced degrees with the appropriate honorific. I also discuss with them that many folks with advanced degrees, once you get to know them, may not want that title used in those contexts. It's reallly not your call, at all. "
Grouchen B,"My goodness!  I can't believe how many people are more focused on Jill's title than on the Covid vaccine or Trump losing his lawsuits in multiple courts.  People, get a life!"
Jo Renn,"Not sure why you would conclude that we are more focused on Jill Biden's title than on the coronavirus.  Most of us read multiple articles on multiple topics each day.   It just happens that this one gets comments because it stands out as being more backward, disrespectful, and counterproductive than those articles.   The real question is: Why would WSJ print such an article. "
William BENTLEY,Disgraceful.   What is the purpose of this WSJ? The days of Trump are over; this kind of behaviour should be as well.
RICHARD LIPPA,Only a petty small-minded man could have written a piece like this.  And only an incompetent editorial staff could have solicited or accepted it.       It's reassuring that the WSJ editorial sectional is addressing the most pressing and significant issues facing our country.
Katy Chung,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child. Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.""I suppose that man wasn't wise enough to realize that the woman actually delivers the child. "
Patricia Weber Sones,"""I suppose that man (Joseph Epstein) wasn't wise enough to realize that the woman actually delivers the child.""Katy Chung, you win the internet today, thank you!"
Peter Berg,"Is there a doctor in the house at the WSJ? If so, we should have the editors' heads examined immediately for allowing such drivel to be published. Ignoring for a moment the breathtaking misogyny and condescension, equating honorary degrees with a PhD earned via study and a published dissertation (which requires original research) is somewhere between a non sequitur and willful idiocy. This is an embarrassment to the WSJ and says far more about the Journal and Mr. Epstein than it ever will about Dr. Biden. Looks like it's time to cancel my WSJ subscription. "
Gregory Moses,"I think we know what is going on here. Had Dr. Biden held a PhD in say high energy physics, perhaps there would not be the desire to diminish her title.BTW, Angela Merkel holds a PhD in quantum chemistry and she is the LEADER of the major economic power in Europe. The Germans are accustomed to stringing titles in series ...  I was known as Herr Doktor Professor ... for instance. I believe a PhD is typically called Doktor and a MD is called Medical Doktor, i.e. with a qualifier, in Germany.  The custom in the U.S. is the opposite, Doctor is colloquially a reference to a MD. Back to my point, I think the issue is her Ed.D., particularly at age 55. The 55 year old PhD's in STEM have usually made some kind of significant contribution to society based on their rigorous and lengthy training."
Thomas Erb,"""Back to my point, I think the issue is her Ed.D., particularly at age 55. The 55 year old PhD's in STEM have usually made some kind of significant contribution to society based on their rigorous and lengthy training.""Exactly, I don't think the Ed.D in anyway compares to a hard science PhD.Individuals with hard science PhDs are typically brilliant."
Margaret Duffy,They're typically brilliant in a narrow field.
Susan Murphy,Says who?  You? Another man defining brilliance.  Love it!  
JAMES HOLLAND,"I have a Ph.D. in English and there is no way I would walk around wearing the title.   It's a hiring qualification, not a statement of erudition as such.   There's no theoretical reason why someone without any degree at all couldn't be as widely read and as competent in languages.   Those who have doctorates in quantitative and clinical areas are in a different situation."
Lee Battite,"Sounds like someone has an inferiority complex. An academic doctorate is granted only after years of study beyond the baccalaureate degree, combined with countless hours of research leading to the publication of a thesis that must meet rigorous professional and academic standards.  That can hardly be considered an honorary title and those who have achieved it should be able to use it proudly and without criticism. Celebrities receive honorary doctorates from institutions on a regular basis, but few if any are so misguided or arrogant as to use it in prefix to their names. "
James Mulvaney,Perhaps a trip back to class as a student might have resulted in clearer prose.  And perhaps a touch of sense that would have eliminated the gratuitous racial jab at honorary degrees.
michael radowitz,"EB...fellas and gals...kids...

Can I write a column or two or so in your op-ed section here? I admit, many of my ideas are not your ideas, but you seem to at least pretend to promote free expression in this section of the WSJ, right?

And I promise my articles will fall within the guidelines involving the number of words. I am good at matching the number limits. Just ask my local paper who's printed my letters and articles over the years. When they limited letters to 200 words, I gave them exactly 200 words. When they increased the limit to 250 words, I gave them exactly 250 words. No argument from me.

So how about it, EB? I may not play pool religiously, but I can write. 
"
Glen Laslett,"Goodness me, what gratuitous pedantry! Dr Biden is completely entitled to use the title provided that she earned it from an accredited university.  Recipients of honorary doctorates should refrain from the use of the title.  "
Jack Gidaro,"Granted, Dr. Biden wasn't an eastern European escort like Moronia

What are you going to do? You take the good with the bad."
Michael O'Malley,"Jaw dropping bit of patriarchal garbage.  I  am glad that Dr. Jill Biden employs the use of ""Dr. "" to broadcast to all those watching her own intelligence, accomplishments and agency even as she takes on the future role of First Lady.  "
Pamela Anne,"Mr. Epstein you are an an unmitigated DISAPPOINTMENT After all that has been said & done by this POTUS living in the landscape of horrific behavior, Rhetoric in the  alternative Reality in the Cult of Trump   You are not worthy to speak about Jill Biden you are a Shill "
Jack Gidaro,FLUSH TWICE - it's a long way to Mar A Lago
DEVON ANDERSON,"I hold both an MD and a PhD. I am every bit as proud of my PhD in engineering as I am of my MD. I find this opinion to be ignorant and callous. For an individual who has not gone through the rigors or experience of obtaining a doctorate of any type, Joseph Epstein is not afforded such an opinion. I will gladly refer to the Madam First Lady as Dr. Biden. "
Patrice La Belle,"As an M.D., I believe that people with PhDs and related degrees, such as Ed.D have worked just as hard as people who, after 4 years of medical school are awarded an M.D. (a degree that doesn't usually require a thesis). They deserve to be called by the title they have earned, if they wish. Dr. Jill Biden also has a MEd and an MA degree. "
John Soppe,"This is very much an 'own goal', as we say in soccer. He goes on about he didn't have to work as hard as others to get a Professorship and is even awarded an honorary. He knows he was given all sorts of invaluable step ups as a result of knowing the right people and being a man in academia. I just signed up for a subscription to the WSJ and now I am having second thoughts. Can we move on from these stupid takes on the culture wars?"
Shari Schnuelle,"This is profoundly ignorant and misogynistic. Dr. Biden's degree is not honorary, she earned it. It's real. It's not comic, and to call it so is disgusting. If you can't parse her dissertation, that's on you. You are condescending at best, here, and likely misogynistic. Ugly. "
PAUL MORAIS,Kudos to you Dr. (sorry but you DO heal) Epstein for pointing out yet another fault in the liberal elite establishment. The fact that they believe that letters attached to their name make them better and/or smarter than someone who has received their education in the trenches.
Christy Nielsen,"The death of expertise is one of the tragedies of the USA.  It's why so many in the population are susceptible to conspiracy theories, doing their own research the results in confirmation bias not clarity. It's  reverse elitism: my ignorance and illogical thinking is equivalent to another's education. An American trope. I'm so over it. "
Margaret Duffy,"Paul, I encourage you to hire a surgeon who has no education for your operation."
Sallie Shatz,"Yo misogynist, patronizing Joe, This says more about your issues than the accomplishments of Dr. Jill Biden, soon to be our First Lady.WSJ, what are you thinking allowing this nonsense?  I would think you would be celebrating that we will have an educated, accomplished roll model as First Lady and you publish this rubbish? I can't wait to have solid role models back in the White House! 39 days until we have Dr. Biden and Vice President Elect Harris to inspire young women!"
Lucian Fick,"My father, God rest his soul, was a anesthesiologist, who during his lengthy career as a trained doctor had a hand in saving hundreds of lives on the operating table, but according to you  no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.Are you an imbecile- or pretending to be one?"
Scott Howard,"This is one of the worst articles I've ever read.Spends three quarters of it talking about honorary degrees,  which is completely irrelevant to an earned Doctorate.  His tone is caustic.I can see that the writer has some very strong feelings about Doctorate programs, but the programs do exist, they do require a lot of work, and rallying against one person seems ill-directed."
Shannon Bell-Peterson,The demeaning of a woman's accomplishments only shows the author's easily intimidated ego- what a weak human he must be and how sad that the wsj would support this rubbish. 
Michelle Woster,"""How sad that the WSJ would support this rubbish"" needs to be underscored.  "
Robert Sanderson,"I'm a lawyer. I have a J.D. degree. I do not use ""Doctor"" socially, but I have the option to do so if I want to. Why criticize someone else's personal choice?"
Dolores Bilges,"I recently signed up for a trial subscription of WSJ and am appalled that this  condescending drek  is chosen for the opinion column. I'm not impressed, and will not be continuing my subscription."
Pamela Anne,I AGREE
Wendy Wentzel,Cancelled mine as well. 
BRIAN SCHROEDER,"With all due respect, this is the most ignorant and insipid editorial I've read in eons.  It is beneath the WSJ to print such tripe.  It smacks of both misogyny and envy.   While my Doctorate of Medicine is something for which I am proud, I would never besmirch the accomplishments of anyone else in this same manner.  Mine is not a superior degree; it is the path I chose, and degree that was needed for that purpose.  Others should not be criticized for following their respective paths. "
David Kleinman,"WSJ's finicky thin-skinned algorithmic gatekeeper -- talk about easily offended -- will be tough to get by with what I'd really like to say. So I'll just say this: You lost me at kiddo, boychik.  A prize for mean spirited pettiness to the editorial page editors.  Whatever you were going for, you missed. "
Kelley Cotter,Pour decision on content WSJ. I  am more than disappointed.
Terry Connelly,"This piece of cheap pedantry and politics  is unworthy of the Journal; two-thirds of it is designed to make Dr. Biden's Ed.D seem the equivalent of an honorary doctorate, which nobody would put  in front of his, her or their name, and for good reason. Would the Journal have devoted its precious OpEd space to an article arguing only that point? Doubtful. The rest of this screed suggests that anyone who has earned a Ed.D, or  a PhD in the ""social sciences or humanities"" -- or is of a certain age -- is unworthy of the""Doctor"" prefix. Would the Journal have wasted  space on an article arguing this point?  No, this is all about taking a cheap shot at a nice lady who happens to be married to the winner because the Journal's candidate lost .You thankfully don't  have the editorial gall  to endorse the Trump campaign's current Constitutional assault, but you want to signal Trump you still play his kind of dirty game. Besides, you don't have HRC to kick around any more.   "
STAN DIAMOND,"In the past Joseph Epstein has written amusing, contrarian views on American culture, that were worth reading even if you did not always agree with him. But since his embrace of right wing politics in general, and Donald Trump in particular. Mr. Epstein's essays  come off as that of a cranky old man, who's America has passed him by. "
Kacey Llano,"Joe, Kiddo, I have to say I disagree with you. Dr. Jill Biden sounds just fine to me. Misogeny much? "
Brian Foster,"It would make some sense for her to be addressed as 'Doctor' in an academic setting perhaps, amongst her peers. but to insist on use of the title in all circumstances seems a little pompous.  If it were the norm, that would be one thing, but it's not."
Victoria Caylor,"Is she insisting on it, or are others choosing to use it? "
Brian Foster,I think it's pretty clear that she wants the title to be used.  No one is imposing it on her.
Karen Goodman,The President of the University I taught at for decades referred to academics by their job title. So I was called Professor. It never occurred to me to use this title outside of the work environment. I think similarly about the title of Dr. for an academic.
Robert Hansen,"After much research into newspapers and their websites, I came across multiple recommendations that the WSJ's news coverage was objective, in-depth and worth reading, unlike those on the far-left and the far-right - - with the caveat I saw many times that unlike the news coverage, the WSJ's editorial page is downright whackadoodle and way off the deep end.  Therefore, when I read the e-edition every day, I skip the editorial page.  This editorial, though, has generated so much controversy that I had to come read it - and the mean-spirited, condescending and misogynist tone does not disabuse me of the notion that the editorial page is definitely worth avoiding."
JIM JACOBS,Are WSJ reporters embarrassed by opinion pieces like this one? 
Gregory Pyle,Imagine being so small minded as to spend time writing an article like this. Now imagine dedicating editorial space to such utter garbage when there are myriad issues of actual national importance facing the nation and the world. The WSJ's decision to promote this absolute garbage has cost them my subscription.
bruce klink,"It's disappointing that the WSJ published this piece. I have no doubt you would never publish an op-ed on a first man keeping his title as ""Dr."" as he enters the White House. Did we really need to give a platform to another man who felt threatened by a powerful woman? ""Kiddo?"" Really? I would've loved a piece on how incredible it is that Dr. Biden is going to be working full time outside of the White House. Is that too progressive to ask? "
Carl Engineer,"Mr Epstein,Your article is mean spirited and possible a bit of sour grapes? It a window into your own character at best. Demeaning Dr Biden who has spent her life doing more valuable things with her life than writing snide articles in the Wall Street Journal is no accomplishment.  Sad and disappointed with both you and the journal."
Edward Metcalfe,"This is self-plagiarism. In his 1978 essay, ""Greetings and Salutations,"" Epstein wrote: Whenever the voice at the other end of the telephone-often a student, but sometimes a nonacademic-begins by asking ""Is this Dr. Epstein?"" I find myself having to fight back the temptation to respond,  ""It is. My advice is read two chapters of Flaubert and get right into bed.""Today's rewrite is hardly different in sense or syntax:During my years as a university teacher I was sometimes addressed, usually on the phone, as ""Dr. Epstein."" On such occasions it was all I could do not to reply, ""Read two chapters of Henry James and get into bed. I'll be right over.""The similarities are forgivable, less so the contradictions. Of the many forms of ""misaddress,"" Epstein's earlier essay found the worst to be  ""the contemptuous familiar"": ""Mac, Ace, Chief, Buddy, ..."" Errr,  ""kiddo""?"
David Kim,"I guess he's trying to be funny and utterly failed, the timing of this op-ed is even worse.  

This is a lot of academic snobbery from someone who attended the state school of Illinois and graduated from an ivy league back up school.  On a side note, Stephen Colbert actually went to Northwestern and is a national treasure. "
WILLIAM BENNETT,"""Fraudulent"" is an apt description for Jill Biden's preference for referring to herself as ""doctor"" and purposefully and misleadingly claiming the public honor most properly and specifically bestowed upon physicians.  Her Ed.D. carries no such weight, and denotes no more knowledge or credibility than that of millions of lesser degrees.  If there is a plea for a ""doctor in the house,"" you'd best hope that she does not respond.But she is married to Joe Biden, academic prevaricator and plagiarist,  so what other behavior should we expect?"
Cerese Feagans,I'm guessing you don't possess an advanced degree in any field and have no personal knowledge of the hard work involved in obtaining one. Too bad for you.
Marilyn Mann,"I don't know Mr. Epstein, but this is so pathetically bad that I wonder if he was drunk when he wrote it.  I have come across other elderly men whose misogynistic tendencies show themselves when they've  had a few too many. Often they imagine themselves as witty when they are really rude and inappropriate. Embarrassing to read. "
Joel Vivian,"WSJ Editors, thanks for showing your true colors, kiddos. One more long time subscriber lost. "
Robert McGinnis,"Who do you think you are? This is the future First Lady you're talking about and you haven't earned the right to call her kiddo. My guess is Mr. Epstein has some deep rooted self esteem issues and felt compelled to write this article for the WSJ. Im not shocked he wrote it, I am shocked the WSJ published it. Here's a suggestion for your next piece, how about a profile of the current First Lady who has been a national embarrassment for the past four years. I'm sure there is a lot more material about her intellectual shortcomings. "
Chris Piller,"If the sexism isn't enough, surely one would expect the author of a piece criticizing use of the title Dr. to actually hold a doctorate. It is quite rich for a bachelors-holding academic to police the academic credentialing practices of a club to which he does not belong."
Jim Walsh,Who cares? A non-medical person who insists on being called doctor is well known as a joke. 
Cerese Feagans,"If I had a doctorate in any field, you can be sure I would use it, and I wouldn't care what anyone else thought."
Jim Walsh,"Its a free country. Know this, you will be mocked by peers. Insisting on being called a doctor in a nonmedical field is viewed as having little mans syndrome. It is considered an attempt to cover for inadequacies. "
Margaret Duffy,"No, Jim, it's not."
Amber Dixon Brenner,"This is disappointing.  One wonders why you took the time to scribe vitriol aimed at a woman,  an educator, mother, wife,  & ""first-lady"" elect?!  You are speaking out of both sides of your mouth, on the one hand scolding her use of a title you demarcate the modern use thereof, whilst praising the original designation.  You have publicly revealed something far more sinister, the hypocrisy of an ""academic"" who fails to understand the true usefulness of an education: to illuminate and strengthen the betterment of sentient beings. Your opinion piece is child's play as is it base, self-serving, and racist.  Citing Greek & Latin as qualifiers for honorary doctorate degrees..?  Given your attention to rank & the bygone approximation of arbitrary excellence,  you know standardized modalities of quantifying intelligence are superfluous, euro-centric, & plain WRONG. You know very well why she invokes her title.  Your words  are redolent of the current squatters at 1600 Pennsylvania  "
Leslie Showalter,"Unbelievable!  How does a ridiculous article like this get published in The Wall Street Journal?1?  Not only is it grossly disrespectful and sexist, it doesn't make sense.  The practice of calling someone who has earned a doctorate ""doctor"" is well established.  I called all of my college professors (undergrad and graduate) ""doctor.""  Younger family members and friends who have been in college more recently did the same.   Why would the WSJ give voice to this small-minded, bitter man who is clearly exhibiting his feelings of educational inadequacy.  "
courtney hunt,"I'm ashamed that WSJ printed this mysogynistic drivel. It's insulting, condescending, sexist, and ignorant. WSJ should not have given Mr. Epstein a platform to trumpet his obvious inferiority complex about not having an advanced degree or his ignorant confusion about the distinction between an honorary degree and an actual doctorate. Appalling. "
CHIP OWEN,"Only MDs should be use ""Dr."" ?  And would it all seem more official like if they mostly look like Marcus Welby MD ; wake up Dorothy - it's 2020 - LOL!"
R Appen,"""Kiddo""?  I'm glad the sexism is obvious at the beginning. "
Rebecca Barber,"I am shocked, appalled and disappointed that the editorial board of what I took to be a serious publication printed something that called the 69 year old first lady of the united states KIDDO.  This is insanely disrespectful to both this woman AND all women.  If you disagree, then I would like to see another editorial calling Pence ""KIDDO"".  We all know that will never happen, because this paper and this editorialist in particularly are well known for their calcified, misogynistic views."
Jim O'leary,The current First Lady has had to endure much worse abuse and some how the feminist were ok with that.  A little double standard?
Anushka Laddhad,"Like what ?  Criticism over ""I dont care, do you ? ""  ?  ""Who gives a darn about Xmas "". Plagiarizing speeches ? I don't see the parallel. What exactly is Joe Epstein's criticism based on ? "
Uraina Pack,"At this moment, I'm thankful that I do not have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.  This article is misogynist and insulting.  It needs to be retracted.  Signed--A Ph.D."
Steve Smith,"Kermit The Frog has an honorary degree, not kidding, look it up. He wants to be called Dr. The Frog."
Cerese Feagans,Jill Biden's education doctorate is NOT honorary.
Carolyn Capaccio,"How dare you? This opinion is repugnant, not to mention factually incorrect, but that is what we have come to expect from the WSJ Editorial and Opinion pages."
Frances Stewart,"I'm an M.D. I'd suggest that Mr. Epstein go to back to school and earn a doctorate. Once he does that, I'd be glad to read his opinion. Until then, it seems like misogynistic sour grapes."
miles derhund,"The party that swears they ain't racist... a prime example of them ""not being sexist"", ladies and gentlemen."
sam williams,This is the end of my WSJ subscription. 
John Chamblee,"I encourage you to retire, Mr. Epstein. You earned your position at Northwestern as a writer. That's what matters in writing. Good for you. In other fields, Ph.Ds. matter. Since you know nothing of these, maybe you should keep mum.
Indeed, maybe you should just keep mum. If this is now ""good work,"" consider the possibility that, by continuing to put your words in print, you may be descending into self-parody. After all, ""Kiddo?""  Not to mention ""a wise man once said?""

Though inevitable, I imagine slipping into irrelevance is hard. Not having ever been relevant, I wouldn't know. It has to be painful, though, as pain is the only explanation for your sexist, racist, irrelevant comments on honorary doctorates. I only ask people to use the ""Dr."" title in a setting where my expertise is relevant, but I did earn my Ph.D. from a top-five program and I did do difficult and creative work to, again, earn it. Perhaps not all doctorates are equal, but you are in no position to judge.

"
Robert DiCarlo,"I'm simply appalled that the WSJ would post such a sexist, outdated and insulting piece.  Dr. Biden earned her degree, a terminal degree that is a Doctorate of Education.  She is entitled to be called doctor if she chooses.  I think the author if this ridiculous piece has an inferiority complex having taught alongside faculty with doctorates at Northwestern.  He should be grateful that Northwestern allowed him to teach as he lacked the academic credentials to do so.   In reading his opinion piece, he also lacks the intellectual capacity as well. "
Nidhi Jain,"Exactly - his ""point"" about how he was falsely addressed as ""Dr."" only reveals that he lacked the credentials that many of his colleagues earned. This piece is dripping with his insecurities."
Daphne Presley,Real Doctors are rolling their eyes at all the bogus doctors out there.
MICHAEL RUPP,The word doctor comes from the Latin 'docere' (to teach).  Physicians (the correct term) appropriated it from scholars.If you had an advanced degree maybe you would know that.
Melissa Fay,"Master Epstein, what a petty and pathetic waste of ink and electrons. "
John Chawner,"I don't know who the author of this piece is, but he's wrong. And that's the nicest way I can put it."
Scott Koven,"WSJ, how did this make it past the chopping block? Not only is this guy objectively incorrect, not only is he disrespectful, but there are SO MANY more important topics worth publishing right now. To the author: First, how incredibly condescending to refer to the next first lady, Dr. Biden, as ""Kiddo"". Second, you don't appear to be someone who values the academic study of education, but if you were, you would know that, in a college of education, if your professor has an Ed.D., you call them ""Doctor"". If a superintendent has an Ed.D, you call them ""Doctor"". If ANYONE has an Ed.D., you call them ""DOCTOR"". It is as rigorous a program as any doctoral degree, and the doctors of education are incredibly important for our society. By insulting Dr. Biden's credentials, you insult the study of education and all educational professionals. "
Brian Maresca,"""Dr. Jill Biden "" sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware through a dissertation with the unpromising title ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs.""Mr. Epstein, we have attempted to condition you for many years in the glories and cosmic truths of political correctness, identity politics, and social justice, and how these cosmic nuggets apply to and settle all questions of the human condition. It is simply incomprehensible how after all this effort of inculcation with the verities of the universe that you STILL refuse to be a humorless, grim, parroter of platitudes, and continue to produce what in the unenlightened past was known as humor, completely unauthoriized outlooks and even opinion.  The offense is noted in addition to the fact that this ""opinion piece"" was aired without a suitable warning of unauthorized viewpoint by the WSJ.  :-)"
Douglas Pettibone,"Joe knew. Check out ""EXCLUSIVE: Hunter Biden Called His Father And Chinese Business Partner 'Office Mates' In September 2017 Email"" at the Daily Caller."
Kate Cannon,"I wonder in what universe Epstein believes that research on retention rates for  community college students  is ""unpromising."" He didn't bother to look at Biden's work or her academic career. Nor does he explain why it would not be worthwhile to examine the retention, transfer, and graduation rates of the over 5 million community college students in the United States. Community college students make up almost 40% of the college student population.  Obviously, Epstein is not current  with scholarship on education; nor is he able to overcome his elitism to view Biden's important research as worthwhile. "

Edward Zareh,"Opinion is consistently the worst section of WSJ. Here's another example. More biased, outdated thinking."
Stephen Morris,I disagree. Opinion is the best part but the censor is becoming very tiresome.
Jonathan Delaney,Opinion is the fun part in terms of comments but not so very good with the actual articles included. Sometimes there are rare glimpses of reality but not always.
David Sorter,"So, let me ask you this. If, by some stretch of the imagination, a woman had won the presidency and her husband, the First Gentleman""  had an Ed.D., would your opinion be the same? I grew up in Evanston, and knew many fine N.U. professors. None of them would have had the poor taste to write this piece."

Mary Kuhn,"This is insulting and ignorant!  We should all be applauding a strong educated woman in the white house.  And this, from the WSJ.  Appalling."
Jim O'leary,Did you applaud the current First Lady?  She has taken enormous abuse and the feminist have never come to her aid.
Nidhi Jain,Let us know when she's accomplished something besides putting in a tennis court and I'd be happy to applaud.
Mahlon Stewart,"You've demonstrated your pettiness and ignorance for everyone to see. Is this now a ploy to dust off any dignity to get subscriptions from the new radical right? This is Brietbart or OANN material. There was nothing clever here. This is something Tucker would have written in high school while we were smoking pot in Arden Diman. It was funny then, and then got stale pretty quickly. Why do I even subscribe? "
Stephen Spigel,"The Wall Street Journal is no longer a respected financial source of information.  It is a scandal sheet designed to placate Rupert Murdoch.  p There have been numerous character assassination OPED pieces publish in the Opinion Section of the paper, but this is one of the worst - uncalled for at a time when the US needs unity rather than attacking a professional who has spent her career promoting the most neglected and disparaged  block of our educational system - the community college.   WSJ should issue an apology to Dr. Biden and reprimand Mr. Epstein, otherwise I will join others and cancel my subscription."
Jim O'leary,The calls for unity by the left are interesting.  They did everything they could to resist Trump and now they want everyone to support sleepy Joe.  Biden deserves the same treatment Trump received!
Mike Holtzman,It's hard for me to understand why the WSJ would run such a sexist commentary in this day of age.  Doesn't anyone with half a brain review these pieces on the editorial board?  It's simply shocking to me.
GREG PROUTY,"Mr. Epstein,Wholeheartedly disagree.  Many of us have earned the title Dr.  I'm sorry you haven't but an MD/DO is NOT the only doctor in our society.Dr. Greg Prouty, Pharm.D."
Michelle Hilton,"Really, is that what occupies your mind these days..."
Patrick Chapman,"If anyone should drop the honorific, it is physicians.  The Ph.D. long predates the M.D.  Early physicians appropriated the word ""doctor"" to make their craft seem more legitimate than it was in the early days.  I don't see how four years of medical school outweighs a doctorate in electrical engineering, for example.  Most Ph.Ds., I know, including myself, do not use ""doctor"" to identify themselves.  While there are some easier majors and lower standards in some places, speaking for myself, I earned it - oral exam and all.  My experience with physicians is that the title is important their egos.  I have to admit it irritates me when people refer to physicians as ""real"" doctors.That said, I think could *all* drop the honorifics as unnecessary and potentially condescending.  "
Stephen Morris,Thin skinned at all?
PJ Huff,It reads as the opposite of thin-skinned.  *insert eye roll*
Ekaterina Koposova,Impossible to decide what's more astonishing - the author's complete ignorance or his utter lack of self-control. 
Jaylen Smith,Kiddo? Pathetic. The only thing he didn't do is call her unattractive. Not surprising given the putrid level of public discourse today. I fear for our society and democracy in the US. . 
Jim O'leary,It's a republic not a democracy.
Brock Bose,"All I can say is that once you have earned a doctorate, you may decide whether you would like to be addressed by the title Doctor... Mr. Epstein"
Karl Borden,"A small correction and a disagreement.  Bill Cosby, whatever his other depredations, does not hold an ""honorary"" doctorate .  He earned a legitimate EdD from the University of Massachusetts/Amherst.I have no use for the Bidens, Jill, Hunter or Joe.  But I do not approve of the usurpation of the ""Dr."" title by medicos.  Notwithstanding the lamentable erosion of standards throughout the academy (equally true in medicine I would add where foreign medical degrees of dubious quality, not all of them doctorates,  are  accorded both the title and the license), I believe Mrs. Biden and others who have run that gauntlet deserve the respect of the title they have earned.  As for the silly honorary degrees - No one I have ever encountered who holds one takes the title seriously or uses it.  "
MARK GILLILAND,"This article is beyond offensive to women and to all who have attained an advanced degree. Mr. Epstein should apologize along with his editor and WSJ management who thought this attack on our future first Lady was appropriate. My household has subscribed to the WSJ for years, but this causes me to rethink the value of your publication."
Steve Smith,"Appalled.  Livid.My first gut reaction told me that I needed to reread Epstein's opinion piece to see if I missed something.  So, I literally did my deep breaths and then reread again. Yet, I still cannot read this without seeing BOLD misogyny in his ending statement--shut up, sit down and be happy in your role as the wifey of the President--AND the ultimate medical snobbery of believing that ONLY medical doctors are ""real"" doctors. I've heard it's ""confusing"" when other people are called Doctor.  That's ridiculous.  The term Doctor simply refers to an accomplishment completed with some long amount of work.  Once earned, it is a legitimate title. What is the point, Mr. Epstein?  Why does Dr. Biden's title bother you? I have a simple BSN, no masters, no ND or PhD, so--No--I'm not defending my own title.  I am just so curious as to why Mr. Epstein is offended enough by a woman with a title and a career to write a whole Opinion piece in the WSJ.Ursula Smith (not Steve)"
Nancy Fedder,Do I sense a jealous man who was given something that he did not earn? Worst thing I ever read in the opinion pages and I have read a lot that I despise. 
Darius Dashtaki,"In nearly 15 yrs as a reader and subscriber of WSJ, this is truly the first time I've felt embarrassed  reading an article.   Calling the first lady ""kiddo"" and publishing this  is beneath the standards of the Journal.   I hope this isnt indicative of the new editorial norm..."
Lucy Flynn,Is this a joke? A parody? I certainly hope so. 
SHARON CHABROW,"Who are you to determine the value of one hard earned degree over another? As an M.D., I am horrified that you would presume to tell someone not to use their academic title. This is blatant sexism, basically implying that Dr. Biden should ""know her place"" as first lady and erase any other part of her identity. I doubt you would make the same request of Kamala Harris' husband were he to have an academic title.You also seem to conflate honorary degrees with actual degrees, further diminishing (in your eyes) the value of one's academic accomplishment. "
Zygmunt Dembek,"It is a fact of life that all doctoral degrees are not equal.  Particularly in the age of online diploma mills.  A more cogent opinion piece could have been written to address this, with active WSJ Editorial intervention.  Sadly, this article has drawn more heat than light. "
Michelle Rose,"What are you even talking about? Jill Biden did NOT get her Ph.D. degree from an ""online diploma mill""!  She got her Ph.D.  degree from a REAL UNIVERSITY. There's nothing to ""address"" !"
Michelle Rose,I am shocked and disgusted that the WSJ would publish this complete drivel.
Sharon Waldron,"What an obnoxious, misogynist piece of drek. To begin with the condescending ""kiddo"" followed by thinly veiled aspersions cast on everything from the University of Delaware to community colleges, you demonstrate only your own shortcomings, Sir.  I doubt she will respond, as she has no need to sink there, but I do wish she would--perhaps with a wittily written piece extolling the virtues of  higher education, degrees, and yes, the promising role of community colleges."
Allie Laurie,I started laughing as I read this but became increasingly sad as I continued reading Epstien's pitiable rant.  I feel really sorry for him. I am also mystified that the WSJ would print something so obviously petty and mean spirited. What was the point in publishing this? Satire?
Amanda Delp,"Dr. Jill Biden's completion of a doctorate degree entitles her to the honorific ""doctor."" The fact that it is called an honorific does not mean hers is an honorary degree... she earned it, and she deserves respect. This piece is a poorly developed misogynistic attack of Dr. Jill Biden in particular, and it is demeaning to women and education in general.Additionally Mr. Epstein, who has not earned a doctorate , apparently has the wrong impression regarding what makes it challenging. If a PhD candidate is fainting from the stress of his OR HER defense, it does not necessarily mean their coursework was challenging or that they have worked harder throughout the PhD or are being held to a high standard by a tough advisor at the defense. Arguably, it implies that they are underprepared for the defense or that their advisor/committee have cultivated a toxic and/or abusive defense environment. This is survival against showmanship, not rigorous original research.Retract and apologize."
JANE ANTLEY,"Joseph Epstein is one of my favorite WSJ contributors, and this piece did not disappoint.  I was already laughing while reading the title, as I have had this same thought many times.   I can certainly understand a professor using the honorific in their professional communications and on their resumes, but in any other case it seems quite pretentious.   I am surprised at all of the outrage, but perhaps I shouldn't be.  Thank you, Joseph Epstein, for your clever writing and observations!"
Jo Renn,"""Doctor"" is a level of education, not a profession or a field of study. A doctorate in science, literature, education, psychology, etc, takes at least 4 years of postgraduate study, similar to a doctor of medicine. Unlike the MD, those other doctorates also require original research and writing; not just learning what has been taught. Also most doctoral programs have much lower rates of completion than medical school where 90% of those who start the program will graduate. Having both and MD and a PHD, I will say that my PhD was more difficult and took longer to complete than my MD. In my opinion, anyone with any type of doctoral degree has equal rights to use the title. I think most MD's would agree with me on that. We don't think that we have the corner on the market of learning. We are quite willing to recognize the accomplishment of those in other fields; something that Epstien is apparently unwilling to do."
Alan Chalek,What an insulting article. You wouldn't have printed this if the subject was a man. The WSJ is Murdoch rag. 
Jeanne Lin,"Isn't it funny that a man without a legitimately earned doctorate would spend so much time and effort to delegitimize a woman who actually earned her degree? Mr. Epstein, you sound like a very petty man trying to make achieving women feel petty about achieving so much.  I also have a doctorate in psychology from the University of Washington and have also been chided by less educated men for using the title Dr.  My father was an MD, and my mother (who was also in medical school but was asked to become a nurse during a wartime nursing shortage) commented that getting a Ph.D. is often much more difficult than medical school, which is grueling, but pretty formulaic as opposed to the process of researching for one's dissertation.  I also thought it illuminating  that Mr. Epstein disparaged her dissertation topic on college student retention ( a critical issue in higher education especially as it pertains to persons of color).  He called it ""unremarkable"". Really? "
Judy Sweeney,Synopsis:  Petty old man pens embarrassingly self revealing attack on woman who has better things to do than he evidently does.   
Tommy Inglesby,Honestly -this is just embarrassing.   Sounds like someone trying to pick a fight.  I think there are more important issues - focus on those.  
Ralph Yasuoka,"At least Dr. Jill Biden isn't going around the US proclaiming, ""I have the very best words, I am the chosen one, Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came, The buck stops with everybody"" and those are from just 2019.  "
Mary Brown,"I'm cancelling my subscription.  This is the final straw after many many ""opinions"" that went too far.  I subscribed to this paper for financial information and advice.  I do not need this kind of garbage.  I don't know when the WSJ decided to let just anyone write without regard to how it might appear to the professional men and women reading the paper.  It would seem no one is doing any kind of review before things are printed.  I have had enough. "
Michael Jones,"""This the final straw after many many ""opinions"" that went too far."" Reminds one of the great line of dialogue from the movie Amadeus: ""Emperor Joseph II : My dear young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. There are simply too many notes, that's all. Just cut a few and it will be perfect."""
Theodora Lau,It is disappointing that this was written. It's even more disappointing that WSJ published it. 
Gary Miner,"I can't believe someone actually took the time to write this opinion piece. Jill Biden worked to get the Ph.D. designation, and if she wants to use it, so be it."
MICHAEL RUPP,It seems Mr. Epstein suffers from PhD envy.  He must be a very small man.Sad!
T Sato,"Have been tolerating a lot of rubbish, especially some unhinged commentary by Kimberley Strassel but this may be the last straw.  Come Monday, I am cancelling my subscription.  I will miss the Weekend Edition and some good book and art reviews.  But overall, good riddance."
B Martin,"interesting set of comments below.  I have worked with many PhDs (not medical Drs but in various technical fields).  I found out that many people that 'flaunt' the title could not back it in up, while the others that did not flaunt it really did contribute significantly to their area of expertise.  An acronym I learned long ago was PhD as in ""Piled High and Deep"".  I have no idea about Dr Biden's expertise and which ""PhD"" camp she might fall into.  Only through an interaction with her might that become evident."
Karen Weaver,"This commentary says so much more about you, Mr. Epstein, than it ever will about Dr. Jill Biden."
Glen Alleman,"This is a whining diatribe, unfounded in facts. Having two adult children, one with a PhD in biology and one with a BCBA-D (Board Certified Behavioral Analyst Doctorate), the title ""doctor"" is bestowed after having qualified for the degree by the their professions.As to the ""facts"" The Doctor of Education (Ed.D. or D.Ed) is both a research and professional doctoral degree that focuses on the field of education. As the highest degree in the field, it prepares the holder for academic, research, administrative, clinical, or professional positions in educational, civil, private organizations, or public institutions. While it may be referred to as a professional doctorate in some jurisdictions, it should not be confused with other professional doctorates such as MD or JD, as these degrees are commonly undergraduate in nature and function as first-professional degrees.I'm disappointed in the WSJ for allowing this unfounded claim to be published, it tarnishes your profession"
Dennis O'Brien,"Just to be clear,  a JD is not an undergraduate degree. Otherwise, I agree with the remainder of your post."
Vijaya Subrahmanyam,"Dennis O'Brein,  A JD is not an undergraduate degree, but it is definitely not a doctoral degree! It is a professional degree that is beyond the undergraduate degree.  It makes a person eligible to practice law in the state where they pass the bar examination.  A Doctors in Law (S.J.D.  in the US, and Ph.D elsewhere) will require one to have  JD and LLM (Masters in Law) before they are admitted to the program and get a doctorate. "
Matthew Kielt,"Confused by this how is ""Juris Doctor"" not a doctorate degree? Doctor is literally in the title of the degree? "
Sandra Reilley,Also to be clear the MD degree is not an undergraduate degree and to use it requires another four to six years of residency training. John Huddlestone
Marianne Plunkett,"I really enjoyed Joseph Epstein's article, -especially his humorous tone.  The degree inflation, of the Ed.D. to be made equivalent to an M.D. degree in terms of rigor and skill; by denoting that Jill Biden deserves the title of ""Doctor"" is part of the Orwellian speech changes we have undergone.  The Ed.D. degrees were promoted by teacher's unions at tax payers expense.  Take a look at how well our education system is doing in the U.S.  Jill got this degree from U of D while Joe was the Delaware Senator.  I hope she has enjoyed how much $$ the Biden family has profited off the US Taxpayer from Hunter's business partners."
N Berry,Jill got this degree from U of D while Joe was the Delaware Senator.Which makes the accomplishment all the more impressive.I'm at a loss what anyone has to gain by denigrating Jill Biden.
Brenden Hawk,"Sadly, the unqualified degrade their betters to avoid highlighting their lack of accomplishment. Case in point.  Classic Trumpian strategy.   I hope when the adults are back in the room we move past this middle-school mentality.  It's going to take some time though. "
Karen Siegel,"Humorous? You - a woman - find his condescending, disdainful, contemptuous tone  HUMOROUS?And no - calling her Dr. is not Orwellian. She is an accomplished, intelligent woman, and she earned every bit of respect that title commands. Clearly you have no respect for academia, or education - so I guess you really are in tune with Mr. Epstein's arrogant disregard for both."
Elijah Gunther,"I guess because of covid-19 the circuses are closed so clowns are finding gigs writing for the WSJ Op-Ed section. Actually, I should take that back, it's too insulting to the clowns."
Karen Bondy,"You don't get to call her ""kiddo"" and if you think Student Retention at the Community College Level is ""unpromising"" you are out of touch.  I'm appalled that WSJ published this misogynist article, laughing  at how easy it is to get a PhD (even though the author doesn't have one).  Ridiculing a PhD college teacher for using her title (and calling her ""kiddo"") is not fine.  My WSJ subscription is in peril."
David Irving,A mistake for the WSJ to publish this junk.  Consumer perception of WSJ brand quality just dropped one point. 
Mary Pultz,"Boy,  I wonder what triggered Mr.  Epstein?   I think the erosion of  the prestige of a Ph.D. has more to do with the anti-intellectualism in the U.S.  than recipients of  honorary doctorates or Ed.D.  degrees.      And certainly President Trump is has now captured a large share of the anti-intellectual electorate."
N Berry,"And certainly President Trump is has now captured a large share of the anti-intellectual electorate.Yes, Mr. Ivy League himself!"
HOWARD BERGER,I am disappointed to see this kind of an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Subscriptions down?
Karsten Jeske,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.""Not a very wise man at all. Let me get this very clear: MDs do not have a monopoly on the use of the word Doctor. The title ""Doctor"" simply means university teacher. An academic title, not at all reserved for medicine. Today's medical school is actually the antithesis of this academic idea. The open secret is that for most MDs, the doctoral thesis is mostly a sham, more of a glorified bachelor thesis. 50 pages of vapid bla-bla that nobody will ever look at again. So, to all the pompous MDs out there: Don't call yourself Doctor until you have taught at a university and you have written a substantial doctoral thesis that has actually advanced the understanding of the academic medical field. That applies to maybe 0.01% of all MDs!By the way, I'm a Doctor, too. A REAL Doctor!K. Jeske, Ph.D., CFA"
N Berry,"So, to all the pompous MDs out there: Don't call yourself Doctor until you have taught at a university and you have written a substantial doctoral thesis that has actually advanced the understanding of the academic medical field.Or delivered a baby, according to Mr. Epstein's 'wise man' -- as midwives have been doing for centuries!"
Robert Longwell,"Another WSJ cuckoo, mr Epstein is proud of being smarter than everyone else, and giving his ""advice"" so cleverly. Another ""back in my day..."" story from a crazy uncle. And WSJ is happy to denigrate education in the new Republican tradition. Just coincidentally, the smear piece targets a woman, a Democrat, and part of the team that beat the WH clown. And of course, education. Does WSJ even have editors? Or just a Murdoch somewhere. "
Elizabeth Nicholson,"She earned a doctorate, she gets to use the title ""Doctor"". Thousands of people rightfully claim the title ""Doctor"" but aren't medical doctors. When was the author born? Yesterday? Do they have any familiarity with the higher education system? Why does she need to ""dumb down"" to his level of understanding?"
Elizabeth Nicholson,"Honestly, I get that this is an opinion piece, and  it isn't the official position of the WSJ, but your journalistic integrity is put into question when you publish a whiny screed that is either incredibly uninformed or biased. "
Alexis Cole,"Simply commenting to underscore the petty, catty tone of this Op-ed. WSJ you really fell down on the job choosing this topic and this individual who clearly has nothing important to say. Every respected periodical and every year deserves better but particularly 2020!"
MARIAN A CAPLAN," I am also a woman with an MD and  have been subscribing to the WSJ for 25 years (though I was not aware there was some length of subscription requirement necessary to express an opinion here). I would describe myself as a  left of center Democrat but I like to read many points of view ( I also subscribe to the NYT and WaPo). I read the Journal for its excellent straight reporting and mostly skim the predictable conservative/libertarian outrage on the editorial page (sometimes the two arms of the paper seem to be operating in parallel universes). Epstein is a reliably old school and self important atavistic columnist who consistently longs for days and mores past  and who appears to be a William F Buckley wannabe (though he does not write as well nor is he as funny). When  the WSJ comment section is trashing you for your misogyny and condescension, you should know you are really out to lunch. Epstein deserves every critical word written here. What a patronizing load of horse manure."
Mike Ray,"Get over it.  Mrs Biden has earned the title of Doctor Biden.  Why argue this.  I do agree there should be less honorary doctorates handed out.  But if you have earned it, then wear the title.No one argued calling my Grand dad Dr. Clevenger.  His doctorate was in history.  "
DJ Enn,"Ok, WSJ - I've seen better editorials in junior high gazettes. Have some standards, eh?"
andrew shaw,"The title of 'Dr' has become so watered down these days that it has lost much of it's meaning. IMHO, it should be reserved for those who have completed medical school."
Margaret Duffy,"The title of 'Dr' has become so watered down these days that it has lost much of it's meaning. IMHO, it should be reserved for those who have completed medical school. It's?"
Traci Rajkowski,"I'm unsure why the WSJ would choose to publish an attack on Jil Biden, because that's what this is. It's smarmy, crude, condescending, and sexist. Sounds like another Epstein we know.  Just sayin'."
Marsha Byers,This article is sexist snd demeaning to Dr. Biden.  The WSJ would never have published this article about a man.  Do better WSJ. 
Arnetta M,Mr Epstein and WSJ. Shame on you!!!  Beyond offensive and archaic. 
AUSTIN TEAGUE,"Obviously the author does not value education.  It takes six years to earn a PhD and most universities require one in order to become a professor, which then requires additional achievements to obtain tenure . A PhD is earned and deserves the respect that the title Dr. bestows"
Douglas Pettibone,"Very true.  The PhD has been so watered down along with every degree down to H.S. over the past few decades.   I like to say that my parent's high school diploma is equivalent to today's college bachelor's degree.   Jill should definitely drop the 'Dr.' in the public setting and should be reserved only for professional settings, such as professional conferences and speeches.  Her apparent insistence to keep it is silly, and shows a personal insecurity.   It's appropriate that physicians be called 'Dr' because the public is their professional setting."
Allison Smith,The bigger issue is how corrupt the Bidens are. This should be the main story but it's not. Shame on WSJ for covering this up before the election.
Elizabeth Gillette,"This is a durn disgusting comment,  and if you are old enough to make it you are old enough to recall Joe has never been indicted for anything let alone tried and found guilty of a crime.  Now, Trump is another story..."
Jonathan Delaney,"All they have left is conspiracy theories and anger nothing more nothing less. If this article was about Melania's education they would be up in arms demanding this ""commentary"" be taken down. If it was about Michelle's education they would be doing what they are doing now. To them their reactions change if the topic is a Democrat vs. Republican."
Katharine Biele,I wonder what you know that everyone else in the country does not. 
Steven Oblack,I am cancelling my subscription as a result of you publishing this commentary from an out of touch old man. Too bad he represents the generation that leads our legislative branch on both sides of the aisle.
Elizabeth Gillette,Make that one side of the aisle only.  The GOP side.
Alex Yun,bro Pelosi is also a boomer
N Berry,"I taught at Northwestern University for 30 years without a doctorate or any advanced degree. I have only a B.A. in absentia....Well, that explains the envy and inferiority complex.  Good for the author's accomplishments, but it's outrageous and pathetic to dare suggest to take away from someone else's.Sorry you're feeling small Mr. Epstein, but Dr. Jill Biden has completely earned that title, for life.  Now she adds FLOTUS for 4 years.  It doesn't harm you.But how dare you speak to someone of such stature as ""kiddo.""  Shame on you."
T Sato,"Just a sad, angry, pathetic man."
Janis Belcher,Many of us are unimpressed by a Phd in education.  The easiest degree to be obtained is in education.  And these PhD's brag and prance around like they are special; they are not.
Katharine Biele,"Really. Were you denied entrance into the PH.D program, by any chance?"
Lee Mequet,"Not a lot of phd's around in my real estate sales career...but there was one guy who used Dr. in his ads and everyday use.  I don't know how much it bought him,  perhaps a bit of prestige, but it did seem  ""bush league"" even to me.  Turned out it was in education. Whatever it takes."
Clark Wolf,"I learned from my scholarly grandparents that the primary meaning of ""Dr."" is in its application to a scholar or researcher with a PhD.  Medical doctors, on this view, are ""Doctors"" in scare quotes, by a kind of courtesy. The MD, I learned, is really just (just?) a vocational professional degree.  It's not as if MDs are scholars or researchers!I loved my grandparents, but their view now seems hopelessly snooty and supercilious, much like the snooty supercilious view expressed here by Joseph Epstein.Epstein's essay the work of a snob. Why? It's not because the honorific ""Dr."" has great meaning, or because people with PhDs merit awe and respect. Obviously not. It's snobbish because Epstein implies that Jill Biden does NOT deserve a respectful honorific because her degree is MERELY a PhD. It is Epstein, not Biden, who is treating ""Dr"" as if it were a magic charm.Mr. Epstein, if we ever meet, I definitely want YOU to call me by my academic honorific. :)"
N Berry,"This is baloney of stunning proportions.  Starting with the absurd notion:A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child. Well, that rules out a lot of neurosurgeouns, brain surgeons, cancer experts and countless other medical doctors. It's been convention for centuries to call someone with a PhD (the ""D"" is for Doctorate) or EdD ""doctor.""   Jill Biden very rightfully earned this title, and should be recognized for countless other achievements as well (maintaining a full-time teaching job for 8 years as Second Lady, marathon-running; not to mention raising 3 children, including two bereaved young boys.)""Doctor"" and FLOTUS can co-exist.  Dr. Jill Biden is just the first to do it, is all. This op-ed is garbage not worthy of the WSJ.  "
James Boivin,"Had to look up just who this author was.  From another source ""JOSEPH EPSTEIN is the author of the best-selling Snobbery and of Friendship"".  As plainly seen, he has the Snobbery down pat, and the complete devaluation of education and what having a PhD means in a field of study.  I understand that the WSJ news is more centrist, and their opinion leans to the right.  However, MR Epstein is leaning into the wind hard on this."
ELIZABETH VANTURE CAIN,"You men couldn't think of anything better to run than this drivel? ""Kiddo""? Seriously?"
KARL KROEKER,"In our country we do not distinguish between medical ""doctors"" and doctorate ""doctors""...some other countries have a distinction which may be helpful.  However the gist of the  opinion piece was not about this distinction for all medical vs doctorate ""doctors"" but rather that Dr. Jill Biden who earned her  doctorate should for some reason choose not to acknowledge that degree that  was conferred on her due to her meeting the requirements of the degree.    It is unlikely this article would have been written about a male.   "
Gustave Falciglia,"So only obstetricians can call themselves doctors? I think a Doctor of Education has a right to the title since the word ""doctor"" comes from the Latin word ""docere"" which means to teach.I haven't delivered any babies but I don't think that man nor the author are so wise.Gustave Falciglia, MD"
Anu Dave,He spent the entire essay bashing honorary doctorates - which is what he got. Dr. Biden did not. She earned hers. Why not just write an opinion piece on how you don't deserve your own honorary degree? This guy can't write a thesis to save his life. He'd never get a real PhD if his life depended on it. 
DAN WOJCIK,Shaquille O'Neal has a doctorate in Education .  
John Harvey,"This is an outrage!   I am a woman and got the WSJ subscription for my husband.  I almost cancelled it when I read this stupid opinion article.  After 4 years of Trumplican misogyny and racism I am sick and tired of these antiquated ideas and media that advocate these ideas.  WSJ - I expect an apology to Dr. Jill Biden.  If I see a strong apology I will keep our subscription.  If not, I will cancel.  Woman now have the power of the 'pocketbook'!"
T Sato,I am definitely cancelling my subscription.
Sophie Russell,"Hey ""Kiddo"" - trying ineffectively to be relevant?  Don't chalk this up to journalistic variation, it is simply puerile, imbecilic and unintelligently chauvinistic.Shame of WSJ."
William Page,"What a piece of sexist garbage! Others have already elaborated on all that is wrong with this patronizing and infuriating perspective, but just to reiterate: Dr. Jill Biden worked hard for her degree while caring for her family and others. How dare this man diminish her accomplishments and demean her degree from a state university? I have nothing but admiration for Dr. Biden and am pleased that she will carry on with her career. It's hard to believe that the WSJ would publish such a  backward opinion piece in 2020. Dr. Judith W. Page,  PhD in Literature and Language, University of Chicago"
Don Riley,"On point as usual, Mr. Epstein. A doctorate in education is and has been for decades more akin to a Crackerjack prize than a meaningful credential of intellectual and professional accomplishment. That she seems to regard its use as a personal honorific is unfortunate at best.In both undergraduate work and medical school in the 60s and 70s, I had the good fortune to study under many Ph.Ds, most of them highly educated in their narrow specialties and excellent teachers. They were worthy of the honorific.As a practicing physician, I was addressed as Doctor at the hospitals and clinics, but in other settings, then and now, I don't use the title, hard-earned as it was. Ms. Biden's use of that title is revealing."
Gustave Falciglia,Some EdD actually require more credits than a PhD. It depends on the institution and the field of study. I don't think you can generalize so easily.
John Harris,"Somebody in the White House faints, fall to the floor....Instinctively, a call for Dr. Jill, and then waste valuable brain -draining seconds with the necessary clarification?The White House has almost always had an MD White House Physician. (... a 60 yrs active surgeon)"
Francis Carbone,"I gather that Jill Biden is going to continue working.  I wonder how Mr Epstein thinks the students should address her?  Professor Biden, Dr Biden, Mrs Biden, Jill - or his preferred ""kiddo""?"
Michael Funk,"Just because the author did not have the desire or resilience to get their doctorate, he is critical of a woman who put forth the effort.  How low can the Journal go?"
Edward Fields,"This is profoundly offensive and I am cancelling my subscription and boycotting all things Murdoch, Inc.  Is there any civility or professional integrity left at Editorial Board WSJ? Any respect for the capitalist democracy that made the M fleet of yachts possible? Disgusting."
Douglas Pettibone,How sensitive we are......
Rob Frieden,Curious whether Mr. Epstein made any effort to correct the likely reference to him as Professor.  That title covers a lot of people including folks not on the tenure track and lacking a Ph.D.  I don't recall anyone quibbling.  I hold an endowed chair and have earned full professor status. I welcome anyone who wants to join me as a professor. 
Rick Lawson,Someone is looking for a shout out from Trump. Is he selling a book or looking for a job?
DAN WOJCIK,She won't be First Lady for long so let her have her day in the sun.  Will Kampala's husband be the first First Whatever? 
Zac Meyer,"The Journal's Editorial Board seems to be operating ""in absentia"" given that this piece was even published. It's a case study in misogyny and outmoded patriarchy. Jealous much, Mr. Epstein? There is much to solve in this country, and it's fine for this  'writer' to have a sexist opinion, but quite another for the Journal to publish it.The piece does not meet the Journal's editorial standards: rampant sexism, mansplaining, patronizing (KIDDO?), deliberately conflating degree types to cause confusion, and judging someone who has spent her life focused on public education are inappropriate and indecent. I'm curious: did  this author pen similar pieces about Melania Trump? Surely her previous nude photos, choice to wait to move to DC until she renegotiated her prenup, or wearing an ""I don't care, do u?"" jacket to visit caged children separated from their parents warrant the same level of self-righteous indignation and judgment?The piece should be retraced, with a full apology."
N Berry,"I'm curious: did  this author pen similar pieces about Melania Trump?No.  I don't care about Mrs. Trump's previous career as a model,  but I recall that during the 2016 campaign,  her website initially made a claim that she held a Bachelor's Degree.  This was quickly edited when it was confirmed that she did not.Regardless of one's respect for degrees, lying about having one is another thing entirely. Highly doubt the WSJ published an op-ed from Mr. Epstein saying to Melania Trump: ""Kiddo, if you don't have a college degree, fine, but don't claim you did."""
leila kashani,"Funny I don't Dr. Kissinger or Dr. Condolezza Rice copied on your memo to ""kiddo."""
ELIZABETH VANTURE CAIN,Spot on!
Jill Zetts,Whose idea was this?  Have some self-respect WSJ.  This is just another way to make us squabble and fight each other.  Don't let them do it.
Mike Dance,"The WSJ is now letting mediocre old men work out their latent issues with intelligent women and minorities in the Op Ed pages, I see. This barely-lucid condescending nonsense should never have been published."
Jo McInerney,"Honestly I cringe when I see the Biden's together.  Poor Jill, I feel sorry for her.  She looks like Joe's nurse so I think she should also drop the Dr. since people may think she's Joe's actual primary care physician.  When she is missing from his right arm he goes off the rail and last month for example, had an interview on CBS and said ""listen to me, just listen, we're going to lose another 250,000 people from the coronavirus by January.  So, we'll have to have 225,000 people die in the next 2 1/2 weeks.  Perhaps if Jill had been there he might have stopped that wild statement.  But, she doesn't seem to be around lately, so his blunders continue and the MSM pretends everything's okay.  Yikes. "
Matthew Bazzano,"We're losing 3,000 people per day. I believe he said we'd lose 200,000 by his inauguration (Jan. 20). I believe he said that on November 18. Since November 18, I think we've lost around 50,000 people. I'm just eyeballing so my numbers may be off a bit, but come on. The pandemic is destroying our elderly communities.  Sadly, I think he will be right because the rate of incidence is just too high."
Jo McInerney,"Your numbers are off and he said 250,000 by January.  We had 265,000 when he spoke and now it's 300,000 so we'd have to have around 20,000 a day give or take.  So, don't believe he will be correct although I know you'll continue to  try so hard to defend this really pitiful man and try to support his notions.  He just announced his Director of the Health and Education Services.  So, is he putting together a new agency, bringing back the old agency that had both Health and Education Services or ?  What do you think - slip of the tongue?  Lost in thought?  Slipped his mind, day dreaming?  "
KARL KROEKER,umm... There is 9 years between President elect Biden and First lady elect Dr. Jill Biden.  There is obvious affection between them.   There is 24 years between President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump and she clearly does not want to even hold his hand in public.   Why would you feel sorry for Dr. Biden?President elect Biden is being realistic about how many we may loose unless we can control the exponential climb.   
Janis Belcher,KK: Because Biden ran; it was elder abuse.
Jonathan Delaney,Elder abuse is what Biden did to Trump.
Jo McInerney,"Nope, I think Hunter Biden has caused and will cause  Joe's elder abuse."
N Berry,"....he [ Biden] goes off the rail...It is beyond imaginable that a Trump supporter would complain about someone going off the rail.  Trump says and tweets absurd, outlandish, patently false, offensive and threatening things every day and ""goes off the rail"" every time he speaks publicly. And you're worried about Joe Biden mis-speaking?!  Biden is no great orator, but Trump makes Biden look like Winston Churchill."
Jo McInerney,"Tweet Tweet!  So what!  Biden:  Open borders, pack the SCOTUS, defund the police, dismantle the military, $5 Trillion Green New Deal (drive? fly? heat? light? computers?), $3 Trillion reparations, $5 Trillion to CA and NY to bail their pensions out, raise taxes, credits back for retirement plans on top of taxes, ban fossil fuels, Paris Climate Accord, Iran Nuclear Deal,  and those are only the ones he's told us about.  Oh, and gun buy backs or gun confiscation."
Matthew Hermenau,*uneducated man shakes fist at cloud*
Jo McInerney,But speaks the truth.  Dr. First Lady?  
Marc Hurel,"While we're at it, why don't we take away your honorific of ""veteran"" for your ""peacetime service""?  Only someone with a serious self-esteem problem would write a piece in which they list all of their (feeble) accomplishments while attempting to detract from someone else's. "
Jo McInerney,Phew - Biden-ettes gone off the rails.
Dan Carnese,"(Dan's wife here)As a non kiddo with a PhD.,  I'd like to point out that you just- put down those of us that work hard and contributed to research against the odds that benefited this country- discouraged those who need a mentor right now and have the new First Lady to look up to as a role model, especially womenWe will prevail in spite of your uneducated, condescending behavior.  "
Kimberley Morgan,This is one of the most sexist articles I've read in the wsj in my life. I'd really like to hear from the editor why wsj  decided to publish such misogynistic piece.  Would the opinionated writer be saying this if a Dr. Biden was a man? I'm beyond offended. I hope wsj can explain to us readers as to why of all the opinion articles to publish they chose this one. 
Susan Murphy,"And while you are at it, you might want to remove the chip on your shoulder that makes you jealous of women who earned a doctorate., while you spend your life at the university as a second class citizen.  With no research skills. "
Jane Coplan,Incredibly arrogant and patronizing. The WSJ should be embarrassed to publish this opinion page.  Dr. Biden's doctorate is NOT honorary.  She is highly esteemed in her career field.  
Diana Dahl,"By the way, Michelle Obama went to Princeton and Harvard Law... and failed the bar exam. Let's get it all out there, folks."
Susan Murphy,"What's your point? President Franklin D. Roosevelt - FDR failed the bar exam on his first try, but that didn't stop him from leading our country indomitably through the Great Depression and World War II.

Kathleen Sullivan - The former dean of Stanford Law, Sullivan has argued cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. But she also failed the bar exam. Although she had passed the bar in both Massachusetts and New York, she flunked her first attempt in California.

Governor Deval Patrick - This Harvard law graduate failed the bar exam twice before passing it on his third time. It didn't stop him from serving as the governor of Massachusetts from 2007-2015. Charlie Crist - He failed the bar exam twice and still managed to become Florida's attorney general and its governor."
Jane Coplan,"Ms. Obama failed the bar exam the first try, passed it on the second try.  Not uncommon. "
Susan Murphy,"Did someone die and make this D bag king?  All fields that grant Ph.D.s call those who graduate with their doctorate, Doctors.  Most universities have faculty who are told to call themselves Drs.  Sorry where this person works  there are no Ph.D.s granted.  What was Melania's doctorate in?  "
Lex Hubbard," I am an MD and practiced medicine for 40 years.  My wife earned her PhD in Nursing almost 40 years ago. Only in our  professional environments have we expected to be addressed as ""Doctor""  - certainly not socially!(Though I do remember along the way, the parents of one of our son's middle school friends demanding the little girl's father be addressed by the kids and the other parents as ""doctor""  since he had a doctorate in sociology and was on faculty at our local satellite campus of the state university.  I thought at the time it was a bit much. )"
David Chester,NA
James Barrow,Why should Jill be any less of a fraud than Sleepy Joe?
John Agnew,I don't understand how in the face of the ongoing Clown Show anyone who graduated from elementary school and has what used to be called a moral compass could write something like this.
Martin Hernandez,Feeling threatened Joe? Dr. Biden is a very nice lady. Don't you worry.
Katie Larsen,"PhD, EdD, MD, JD, PharmD, DC, DMD, etc., all of these are earned. They take a significant amount of work. It does not matter how old you are or how long it takes. it doesn't matter what your passion is. What they all have in common is hard work to EARN the degree and some third party to determine that you have earned the degree. Let us not diminish the value of hard work.  We have diminished so much else. Honorary doctorates are given away.  They take no work. Just because you think it, doesn't mean you need to say it. To the WSJ, just because someone writes it, you don't have to publish it. To Mr. Epstein, thank you for your military service.  That is the only good you have done. If you were truly an educator for so many years, you would have let this Op-Ed sit .  The purpose of education is to teach people to think, ponder, or appreciate the other perspective , not evoke defensiveness and decisiveness.  "
Rick Thomson,"Nota Bene everyone: the degree Ed.D. is a Doctor of Education. That is a different degree with different and generally less strenuous requirements from a PhD - a Doctor of Philosophy - whatever the field, and only certain institutions can award them. When I was in college, no one used ""Dr."" for PhDs at ""old school"" institutions because it was assumed that most faculty members had one, but that distinguishing themselves from those who did not was impolite or ostentatious.For the record, we all recognize that as DDS is a different degree from MD or DVM but we call them all ""Doctor"" since they are in the business of medicine and healing. In other countries everyone is called ""Mr. or Mrs/ms. except physicians -- even surgeons. I call people what they want to be called, in or out of school.Rick's wife Jean Meade, PhD ( Philosophy)"
Sharon Stout,"""I call people what they want to be called, in or out of school.""   Excellent rule.   "
Arun Raj,"Wow, is this what I pay $20 a month for? "
Brooke Bredbeck,You don't have to! There are better journals.
Shawn Jensen,"Mr. Epstein, if this were an article about a man, would you also ask the same question?   Seriously.  Would you belittle them in a petty way like this?  Saying she is 'almost comic' for having a higher education is insulting.  It would be insulting whether male , female, young, old, or other.  This is one time when what you mother taught you should have been at the forefront of your mind: ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"". "
Diana Dahl,He did belittle men.

Shawn Jensen,"He only belittled men who attained honorary doctorates, not earned doctorates. "
Monica M,"According to Merriam-Webster (in today's tweet!) Doctor comes from the Latin word for ""teacher."" How bout that!"
Jeanne Kuriyan,Good universities require teachers to have a Doctorate degree.  It's a required qualification.  Not an MD.  But a Ph.D.  Sad that Northwestern doesn't have that policy.  Perhaps they will reconsider. 
Mark Sellke,"Tom here.""Good universities require teachers to have a Doctorate degree.""That's rather like the opinion that good wine only comes in bottles with corks.Have you ever heard of Freeman Dyson?"
Arin Goldman,Kiddo?  Really? Apologize and retract.
Billie E,"Misogyny at its finest. Well done, WSJ, well done."
Randall Zisler,"Mr Epstein, before you judge others on whether or not they should be called ""Dr"" perhaps you need an education on the titles for PhD. Anyone who receives such an honor is entitled to call themselves ""Dr"" which is why you can write Dr Jill Biden PhD rather than Dr Jill Biden, MD.  Yours is a small/bore, petty slight that likely reflects your ideological strait jacket.  Having an educated First Lady after the occupant of the previous four years will be an inspiration and pleasure.  Dr. Biden has an enviable record of public service, integrity, and expertise.   Can you offer comparable credentials beyond your obvious mendacity and misogyny?"
WSJ Demo,"Sir, you have more issues than Vogue."
John Agnew,"Where I grew up physicians only had bachelor degrees. Specialists insisted on being referred to as ""Mr."" back in the day. Today ""Mr./Ms"" works. So, who are the ""real"" doctors? I must admit that I use terms like physicians and surgeon for so-called medical doctors. For me a real doctor is someone who studied something and wrote a dissertation on it. Epstein is channeling his mother, I suspect, who is probably deeply disappointed that he writes preposterous tracts for the WSJ rather than being a ""doctor"" of any sort or, even better, a lawyer, with or without a JD."
Edward Comer,"Why is this ""opinion"" worthy of publication in the WSJ?  Its sexist nonsense.  Instead, where is the WSJ editorial asking Melania why she is not graciously welcoming the next First Lady to the White House?  Oh and I have been a subscriber for a long time.  "
C Christian,"Well said. Good Grief WSJ, while I laud free speech, Journals need to have standards. This is a pretty low bar"
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Just like to note that many of the commenters critical of this post are first time or new commenters to the Wall Street Journal.   It as though an e-bulletin went out to the Biden camp asking folks to subscribe to the WSJ in order to defend soon-to-be FLOTUS Mrs. Biden.Note to the WSJ - accept their money, but please put their comments into perspective."
Diana Dahl,The WSJ has been only publishing liberal/anti-Trump  articles on Facebook; it is pretty clear they are trying to broaden their audience with that avenue.
Matt Hollenbeck,"This is the first time in 15 years I felt so strongly enough to respond online.   I'm just a data point, but not from the Biden camp."
John Hill,"I am a subscriber and your post is the first that I found.  I have no idea what education level you or Mr. Epstein have, but many of us, women with advanced degrees, had to go through our professional lives when others ignoring or belittling them. I remember when Clinton and Gore were elected, after the limited intellectual capacity of Reagan and Bush Sr. - what a fresh air it was to have two high achieving  individuals as our leaders.  What an example they would send to high school kids.Go ahead Dr. Biden, carry your achievements with pride.  What an example you and V.P. Elect Harris offer to young girls in school.Hanna Hill, Ph. D. Microbiology, the University of Chicago"
C Christian,"Agreed. C. Christian, Ph. D. Astrophysics. To quote a fellow Ph. D. ""we were doctors when they were barbers"". Many of us believe medical personnel with degrees should be called Physicians and we are the doctors."
steve varga,Clinton put the spot light on interns amongst other things
Brooke Bredbeck,Thank you Dr. Hill! This lifted my spirits and they needed that today. Women who have overcome so much sexism deserve every achievement they've earned. Brooke Bredbeck MD
Diana Ross,Agreed.  Diana Ross (yes my real name!) PhD (Cantab).  
Diana Dahl,"All the outrage from the responses (mostly women; you aren't allowed to criticize a woman!) is silly because Democrat leadership is going to toss Joe to the side (using the laptop excuse)... and we won't have to argue for long how eye rolling it is to call Jill a ""doctor"".Instead... we can talk about how President Harris failed her bar exam... and only got 1% of the primary votes. Even Democrat voters didn't want her. "
Erin Childress,"Yes, Kamala Harris failed her bar exam on the first try.  She hasn't denied that. If you would take some time to educate yourself, you would know that the CA bar exam has one of the lowest pass rates in the country.  In February, only 26.8% passed the bar in CA.  CA also has a higher cut score than most states and is considered to be one of the most difficult in the country.  If you stopped to think through that for a second, it would tell you the requirements in CA are higher.  But don't let facts get in your way."
Diana Dahl,Ok. Let's address the only getting 1% of the votes in the Democratic primary. Democrats voters soundly rejected her. Yet... here she is. Odd.
mike piazza,"So if one criticizes a Democrat first lady's pretentious degree and title, it's misogyny. You're all crazy.  "
Michael Rigaud,"pre.ten.tiousattempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.You're joking, right?How can a PhD in anything be pretentious?People can be. But a degree?"
mike piazza,"Mike - It's an Ed.D, not a Ph.D.  Do a little research. "
Billie E,They never do this to men. It is misogyny. That you can 't recognize that says more about how crazy you are.
mike piazza,"I guess you haven't seen how Trump has been brutalized for the past four years? How about Kavanaugh? Flynn? The best female leaders you can muster are Clinton, Harris, Pelosi and AOC? Seriously? Quit playing the victim card and man up.  "
Elizabeth H Sutherland,"As a woman with a PhD, I'm delighted that our new First Lady will be well educated and will continue to use her skills. It's important for all of us to see a high-achieving woman in that role. Poor Mr. Epstein is clearly sad and bitter that he himself never achieved a higher degree. That having been said: sir, you do not address *any* woman you don't know well, let alone the incoming First Lady of the United States, as ""kiddo."" Who thought it was acceptable for this piece of disrespectful garbage to appear in print?"
Joseph Hight,"This is a snarky article. Jill Biden is not passing herself off as an MD, and I don't hear her insisting on begin called Dr. Biden, but she did work for her credentials and she is using what she has earned and learned by teaching community collegestudents and from  all accounts is doing a good job at it."
C Christian,Thank you
Linda Howelton,"Mr.  Epstein, methinks thou protest too much as in who made you  arbiter on how someone else desires to be addressed?  Dr. Biden has been referred to as ""Dr"" for fifteen years so now it's a problem for you.  It appears that you are the one with the problem .  This comes from a woman with a medical degree who respects Dr. Biden and will use the title she prefers.  "
Delena Spencer,This is the most offensive thing I've read in the WSJ.  Shameful.
Carole Meagher,"Get over yourself. Fine, MD>PhD>EdD.  Well, when you complete a Master's degree, do a few years of coursework, and write a 100+-page research paper, you have every right to complain if you don't think the title ""Dr"" is worthy.You realize that an ""Honorary Doctorate"" isn't even an academic thing."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Those of us with PhDs know there is a hierarchy Math, PhysicsChemistryBiological sciences (mine)Then way downSocial sciences, economicshumanitieseducationMs Biden exposes her insecurity about her bottom of the heap doctorate.  "
Diana Ross,"Do we now?  I have a PhD in hard science from a global top 10 university and I do not for a second deprecate any other PhD or anyone else for that matter.  She exposes only her credentials to teach.  While you in fact expose much more.   What made you so elitist?  Really, we are all hurtling towards the grave.  Grow up please.  She is a practicing educator with a doctorate and as such it's completely normal to use her title."
Maureen DiRienzo,"Oh please.  People who use the Dr. title outside of their work environment are trying to pass themselves off as more than they are.   Really uninformed people will assume she is a physician, as was the point of the article. "
david carlson,Do we now? What an absurd thing to say.
Kate Cannon,"Oh how wonderfully self serving of you to believe your PhD in biology ranks above a degree in the humanities in social sciences. No, ""those of us with PhDs"" do not believe this sort of arrogant nonsense.  I have a PhD in American history from UCLA.  The framers of the Constitution believed that education was key to the continuance of our democracy. A well rounded education in the  liberal arts exposes students to critical thinking skills and the core ideas at the foundation of our nation. We know all students benefit from an integrated curriculum of humanities, social science, science, and the arts. Each have their place in a society of educated citizens. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"OK, can an astrophysicist pass a course in Am History?  sure.Can someone majoring in history pass a course in astrophysics?  Not likely.Therein is the distinction.  Only really brilliant, analytical minds can do something like math or astrophysics while many can do history.  Thus, the hierarchy.   "
Kate Cannon,"Is your assertion based on evidence or just your uninformed bias?  Astrophysics in not a required course.  However, American history is because all students must understand U.S. history and the Constitution to be informed citizens. I have had many STEM majors in my classes. Typically, they have poor writing and critical thinking skills. This is because courses in STEM do not require essay writing, extensive reading, or analysis of primary sources. History courses are not easier for STEM students. In fact, because their education tends to be specialized, they often struggle in humanities and social science courses. "
Maureen DiRienzo,"Actually Kate, it's based on evidence, my own experience in academia.You say students must understand US history and the constitution? Not for a long time.  Their heads are filled with PC mush requiring no critical thinking skills at all.  Just write what the professor believes and collect your A grade.  No faking it in math or physics.  You either answer the questions or you fail.American academia is now a failure thanks to the soft social sciences and humanities and, yes, education departments filling kids' brains with PC drivel.  Doctors, indeed.  "
Sarah Bartlett,"As a graduate student with two bachelors degrees in one Anthroplogy andclassical studies and the other in political science, who managed (easily) to graduate in 4 years phi beta kappa and who speaks Latin, modern Greek, Ancient Greek, Italian, French, Japanese, and English. Some of us seeking PhD's do still learn more than one language, not that that has anything to do with anything. This is tone deaf and misinformed."
Christine Wantland,"Why has the WSJ published this? Apparently the writer has terrible feelings of inadequacy over his lack of an advanced degree and spends a good deal of time chastising Dr Biden for having earned one; then he yammers for paragraphs about his disdain for honorary doctorates, except this doesn't apply to Dr Biden. Mr Epstein needs a hobby. "
Wendy Wentzel,   I don't think he even realizes how disjointed it is.
robert haggard,"Wow, Joe you've punctured a lot of egos here. And if many of the posts are to be believed, you have eliminated a lot of snowflakes from the subscriber base. Good work, keep it up. I'm an Epstein fan and I will stop and read anything with his byline. He calls em like he sees em. And to all the dissenters, I bet Joe is really enjoying this."
Chris Williams,"A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.Women have delivered all the children all the time, everyone else is merely a helper."
Lisa Parrack,Not in the case of a C-section.
Matt Hollenbeck,"This does not belong in the Wall Street Journal, diminishing all the content that surrounds it.   As stated by many other commenters, 80% of the text is devoted to the author's own experience as 'not-a-doctor' (which sure sounds jealous of those who were) OR completely irrelevant commentary on honorary doctorates.   The 20% that actually addresses the intent is the kind of sexist garbage that allows reasonable, well-educated conservatives to be lumped into an anti-education, anti-science, anti-culture pot that the progressive left loves to attack.   I am appalled to be associated with this piece by in some small part paying for it be printed.   Education is a science Mr. Epstein."
Diana Dahl,"Getting a thesis from a community college extension does not warrant the nation having to address one as ""doctor"".  Jill better get used to the snickering behind her back, which has probably happened plenty."
KATIE HULL,Diana: behind the back snickerer
Diana Ross,"Good lord, Diana, you must be fun at parties.  Dr Biden did the work and has continued relentlessly to help kids get ahead in life.   What have you done lately to earn respect? I don't use my Dr title as I do not work in my field any more.  She is utterly entitled to do so but I'm more interested in the elitist world you come from to actually think it was OK to write that remark.Signed, you alter ego Diana from the world where Spock does not have a beard."
mike piazza,Education is a science? These Democrats have gone completely bonkers.
Matt Hollenbeck,registered republican here.  are you saying that things other than engineering and medicine cannot have scientific study applied or taught?   No doubt the institution conferring the degree has a lot to do with the quality - but PhDs are PhDs.
tim harris,"They must belive that education, literacy and math has really improved in the last 30 years with the proliferation of Ph.D's."
Matt Hollenbeck,"Two statements you imply there Tim: 1. ""PhD's have proliferated ""- probably true, but so have college degrees in general, in response to the economy's expectations AND the underwriting of college debt.   The question is how much proliferation was necessary to keep up with the evolving educational system/population, and how much was superfluous?   2. ""Education has not improved in the last 30 years"".   That's a deep topic that can't be stated that simply.   It's evolved for sure, and not all for the best but not all for the worst either given technology.   Test scores, GPAs, and other achievement metrics are as much an outcome of parenting as they are educational policy.   Truthfully, until we start treating educators as professionals that can differentiate themselves via a meritocracy (which unions can restrain), educational achievements are the only way.  No wonder more current teachers are going for advanced degrees, and why we have a teacher shortage in many places."
Laura Murray,"I am deeply disappointed that the Wall Street Journal would publish the piece of pretentious misogynistic sludge. This belongs in a fish wrapper, not a real newspaper. Do better. "
Andrey Zubkov,"""Kiddo"". That'll be my last memory of this pathetic carcass of a news outlet that glorified Melania for years and is now doing journalistic rot. You used to be the gold standard.This is the opinion piece that finally got me to cancel WSJ. There is no point to this type of an opinion piece. It doesn't raise important questions. There's no insight, no perspective. No introspection, and nothing news-breaking or noteworthy. It's a sad rant that attempts to diminish an incoming first lady's education without raising any valid points. There's name calling, there's bias, and there's my cue to hit that cancel button. What a sad, prolonged demise for such a storied publication. I feel terrible for the few dozen talented journalists that you still employ."
Bill Sheridan,"Kiddo? Who are you to disrespect the next First Lady? And thank you, WSJ for putting this important piece up. "
Rani Batra,You are a small and petty man.  Shame on WSJ for wasting space on this drivel.  Dr. Biden has earned her degree and is entitled to proudly use her title as many other PhDs have done.  She appears to be a lovely woman and a dedicated teacher and public servant who has used her time and talents to help others. I wish more people on these pages could follow her example.
Thad Zajac,"As another doctor once famously said in a smash hit movie, ""HOW ABOUT NO?"""
Kate Bridgman,"The WSJ just published a misogynistic screed telling an accomplished, intelligent, dynamic woman to get basically get to planning dinner parties and decorating the White House when she becomes First Lady. I'm so disgusted with the fact that the WSJ has given this chauvinist a platform to spew his bile, I've cancelled my subscription. SHAME. "
Diana Dahl,"If women want to be treated as equal, take criticism like a man. Sorry, but I also roll my eyes at someone expecting people to call her ""doctor""... from a paper she wrote at a community college extension. The writer is only saying out loud what many have been saying behind Jill's back for years."
Jonathan Delaney,The only people saying that will be bitter conservatives mad they cannot get the same education she did and people like Epstein who thinks he is better than her.
Indranil Ghosh,"I am appalled at the attitude and disrespect shown to the soon-to be- first lady in this article. ""Kiddo""? Seriously? For the last four years I have watched a publication that I once held great respect for, become a Trump propaganda machine. Just like Rupert Murdoch's other properties. Time for me to get my business news from elsewhere."
Greg Coticchia,"She earned her degree and Mr.Epstein, you clearly no nothing about an advanced degree. 54,000 PhDs conferred per year. Its an enormous accomplishment by any individual in any field. This commentary is disgraceful to those who accomplished this academic achievement and also Dr. Biden. "
Wally Marx,"How elite can you get? ""Listen to me! For I, yes I, am a scholar."" I guess that's one way to cap a career. "
Sonia Kanigel,"Among many other bad things one could say about this piece, it's basically an extended humblebrag - from a man urging the future First Lady to be less pretentious. If there are honorary doctorates for being insufferable, petty, and oh-so-small, I nominate Mr. Joseph Epstein.A note for the editors: Although Mr. Epstein makes some distinction between Dr. Biden's (genuine) doctorate and the honorary doctorates handed out to celebrities, the overall effect of this piece is to lump them together into so much useless academic sludge. I would think it's your job, at the prestigious WSJ, not only to catch flat-out errors but to notice this more nuanced type of problem and request changes before the piece is published."
Marc Satterwhite,"I have more than once wished there were separate titles for medical doctors and PhDs, but there aren't.  Anyone with a doctorate is entitled to be addressed as Dr.  if they wish.  Personally I don't use Dr. socially, but I have no trouble with people who do."
Bailey Palmer,"As someone who not less than an hour ago was sobbing on the floor from the stress of phd examinations, I can assure you they have not become easier. The author is just incredibly misinformed and incompetent and sexist, to put it politely. "
robert whalen,I had grueling orals and defense of thesis. I didn't cry on the floor. Life is tough.I hope that you go into academia because the real world will eat you alive.
Eric Sanderson,"Why would the WSJ waste editorial space with a meaningless article like this?  What they should write about is how Trump, rather than wasting all of the judicial resources filing frivilous election cases, should instead start a reality TV show where his 3 oldest children confess their crimes and complete in a contest to receive a presidential pardon. "
Lisa Fittanto,"Dr. Jill EARNED her doctorate, she didnt get it as an honorary anything.Coming from a supporter of a criminal and a conman cheat with an ex adult model, you have quite the nerve to try to denigrate an educator and an actual accomplished woman.Shows the infantile smallness of the op ed writer. Another misogynist trying to diminish a woman's accomplishments."
robert whalen,"Women just seem to so easily fall to pieces.If this article were about a man there would be hardly a male who would bring gender into a discussion (""How can you be so mean to us guys!"") of credentials.This is the silliest burst of feminism since Pat Schroeder wept herself dry on the capitol steps.Ms Biden campaigns for her politician husband. If she can't stand the heat, she should go back into the kitchen."
KARL KROEKER,The fact of the matter is that the article would not have been written if it was a man and certainly would not have suggested a man be addressed as kiddo.   
Jonathan Delaney,Your last sentence exposed you for the type of person you really are Robert. Dr. Biden has experience being in the campaign spotlight from her husband's senate campaigns and as VP and now POTUS. She can take the heat as she has experience in being in the public eye.
robert whalen,"She, perhaps, CAN take the heat. That is what a professional does and, if so, I tip my hat to her.As for the weepy women who, needlessly, rush to her defense? Well, there is a reason some men  -- wrong as they may be -- don't take females seriously."
Sharon Stout,"""... Well, there is a reason some men  -- wrong as they may be -- don't take females seriously.""  You just put yourself firmly in that camp.  You're wrong, too.  Own it.   Weepy?  No, angry.    There is plenty of misogyny in the world -- and in academia in particular -- and many of us have experienced it.   No need to add to it or defend it.  Stopping there.  Hereafter, I will ignore you.  "
Rick Benson,"Way to go Mr. Epstein, you must of struck a nerve with all of the critical comments below. "
robert whalen,"The nerve he struck is the tergiditus nervum. It is especially sensitive to be punctured.He has enraged the holders of Cracker Jack box diplomas --- PhDs in education, physical education and such-like trades.  Their name is Legion.Their knowledge is Scant. "
Diana Ross,"This hard science Phd disagrees.  His puerile misogynistic article required a rejoinder and we have given it and his and your voice will not change that.  What you are hearing is a very loud ""enough"".   And that includes the ""enough"" of the people in November.   What part of that don't you understand? "
Heidi Parsont,"Yet another sexist  opinion piece. You have the nerve to comment on a women who has a doctorate in education and has dedicated her life to public service. At least she has actually done meaningful work unlike  the current FLOTUS, for which you never comment, who was a former stripper, at best. Just because you feel insecure having never gotten your doctorate, this doesn't give you the right to condemn someone who wants and deserves to use Dr. How about the so-called 'lawyers' who have brought about frivolous lawsuits and should lose their law licenses. Perhaps they should lose their esq after their antics. Nope. Instead you wish to condemn a woman who has worked hard to earn her degree and has used it to help those underserved. I think you have better things to be concerned about, including the fact that almost every woman and most men will see through this veiled attempt at sexism. You should go stick your head in the sand and come out in 2030 so you can see what equality looks like."
Robert D'Augustine,"As someone who worked in higher education for 42 years, I was amused both by Dr. Epstein's opinion and by the ferocity of many of the comments on it. Can we all take a breath and acknowledge that it is silly to get either huffy about Dr. Biden's being called ""Dr."" or offended by Dr. Epstein's scornful reaction. Does Dr. Epstein object to addressing a dentist or a veterinarian by the title Dr.? How about an O.D. (doctor of optometry) or a D.C. (doctor of chiropractic)?A little history on the subject might be in order. Centuries ago, only theologians were ever called ""Dr.""  Until very recently, surgeons in England were called ""Mr."", because historically they received their training through apprenticeship programs rather than at universities. And yet, going back only a century or so in England, ""Dr."" was considered a less prestigious title than ""Mr."" because it made clear the individual worked for a living (and therefore was not a gentleman).Space limits force me to stop. :-)"
Ted Torphy,"Perhaps Mr. Epstein is filled with a bit of white male resentment because he was unable or incapable of earning a PhD? I admit to believing that calling anyone ""Dr."" in an informal setting is a bit too formal for contemporary America, but the editorial seemed little more than a thinly-veiled hit piece on Jill Biden."
ELLEN MANNOS,Piled High and Deep.
BARBARA LEE,I lived with someone who has a PhD.  Do you know what it takes to get one?  After all that hard work they deserve the title of Dr.   This is nothing short of insulting to all who have one to suggest they drop their title.   
Jim Winston,"I worked in what is called ""higher education"" in this country for 35 years.  An Ed.D is an ersatz degree.  Everyone knows that in academia--everyone.  College administrators gets an Ed.D in some bogus field like ""Educational Leadership"" (1) to justify their inflated salary and (2) so they can be called ""Doctor.""  The author is 100% correct in his assessment.  Question for those who will disagree with me: Why was the Ed.D created in the first place?  Why not simply call it a PhD?  Because it's not a PhD.  Not even close.  "
ELLEN MANNOS,"Yep! Those were being cranked out like carter's  pills - university cash cows! Unless you're committed to life-long research in something valuable to society, behavioral health, science, technology, etc., then useless. "
Danielle Hernandez,"And this is why we our failing our children in the United States-because we do not value education, its theory, practice, psychology, politics, or optimization. As long as negative perspectives of those giving their lives to studying and bettering education prevail, we will never be a great nation; not even a good one. "
Josue Rodriguez,"This works as clickbait, but not as an educated opinion. Also, it waters down the WSJ content... "
Robert Ginsburg,What a superfluous piece. A whine without a purpose.Mr. Epstein owes everyone an apology for the wasted time and bandwidth this article represents.
Joan Walsh,"I am a retired community college professor with a Ph.D in nutrition.  Mr. Epstein, I'm not sure what you've done that's worthwhile in your life, but English professors in community college take students with writing skills that run the range from excellent to very poor, and through many hours of supportive instruction and the use of a red pen, elevate the use of the English language for tens of thousands of students each year.  Being able to communicate well in writing is foundational to success in almost every field of work, and these skills literally change lives.  That she wrote a dissertation about student success and retention signals that she wanted to know more about how to help these students.  Your contribution is a glib and insulting piece written by an ignorant person."
Victoria Tacia,"This writer carries a lot of baggage surrounding titles and degrees, he should see someone about this. "
Nancy Fisher,This is mean spirited and sexist.  The CEO at our local hospital got his PhD at Phoenix University and loves to be addressed as Dr.....  Of course he is male so I guess no one objects.  
robert whalen,Use another hospital if you get sick.
Joshua Ocampo,"Instead of introducing yourself as Author/Writer Joseph Epstein, might I suggest the title ""Unpleasant Uncle"" instead? If I wanted to hear an opinion this petty, I'd go to a family reunion or a contentious Thanksgiving dinner for free, not my subscription to the WSJ. The term ""Doctor"" also comes from the latin docere, meaning ""to teach."" An Ed.D or PhD absolutely counts. "
Glenn Walsberg,"This is a remarkably foolish opinion piece, replete with ignorance and sexism.   It is embarrassing to both the author and the WSJ.Signed:  Glenn Walsberg, PhD (Yes, I'm routinely addressed as ""Dr."", but I guess that the author will condescend to agree that might be appropriate, since I'm male, the degree is 45 years old, in a science, and I had a language exam.)   Now, as for that B.A. in English..."
David Sumner,I submit that Dr. Biden is better at life than you are.
Sharon Stout,"Jill Biden shouldn't call herself Dr. Jill Biden even though she has a doctorate in education from U. of Delaware. Yeah, right.  I have seen multiple rules on such usage.  My brief summary?   1)  Dr. preceding the name should be used only by medical doctors.  All others should use the approved initials for their particular doctorate after their names.   2)  Use of Dr. in academic settings (e.g., professional conferences) is grandstanding, given the presumption that everyone participating has one.   3)  Use of Dr. in community settings is inappropriate, given a presumption that all are participating on an equal footing and academic credentials are irrelevant.   4)  Deleting the use of titles like ""Dr""  and ""Reverend""  in the Black community is a sign of disrespect.  5)  When men get their doctorates noted,  women's should be noted, too.   (Right, Dr. Kissinger?)  OR -- more simply -- if in doubt about names, titles, and pronouns, ask and use what the individual prefers.Epstein's eaten sour grapes?"
Sharon Stout,"Sorry!   Ran out of space for vital rule  #6.  6)  If in an argument or dispute, you feel compelled to tout your own credentials, you've lost.   Arguing with a garage mechanic?  ""I have an MBA from Wharton...""   No, no, no.Expertise is  context-specific and self-evident.  You have it or you don't.  "
michele peltier,how can the WSJ print such dribble?
Elizabeth Lenue,"Thank you for publishing this piece today. My subscription renewal date is December 15, 2020. I appreciate the heads up. It's not me, it's you. Buh-bye."
Jennifer Crispin,"I'm in an introductory offer right now, but they're on notice-- they'd better improve before I consider paying full price!"
Michael Sartin-Tarm,"This is some of the most demeaning drivel I've ever read. Someone who earns their doctorate deserves their title, full stop.Imagine the gall of this person, who themselves admits they didn't earn their title, telling someone else they can't have theirs in turn.  Not only this, but it's a man telling a woman this, straight after he calls her ""kiddo"".How about you stop telling women how they're supposed to act and what title they're supposed to use. As you fully know, no male has to use a term  like""Mrs."" after they become married. In the interest of fairness, a term like ""Dr."" should be more usable by women than by men, to allow them to use a term without revealing their gender and marriage status. The term they choose should be a choice that they themselves are free to make, without pressure.Anyway I can't believe I'm financing articles like this as well. That'll change soon."
David Lai,A rambling incoherent rant that has nothing to do with Jill Biden.  
Lisa Parrack,Precisely.
caren Gallaher,"Interesting how many people I have asked thought Jill Biden was a physician. I don't deny her the use of the term Doctor..she earned it. I do think using the term Doctor in a clinical setting remains a confusing and disturbing trend. Patients need to know to ask those who are delivering medical care what degree  they have and understand the discrepancies and capacities of education, treatment abilities. Perhaps this is just the opportunity to bring attention to the fact that non physicians are legislated to practice medicine in 24 states. Doctor means different things in different settings but in the hospital and in the exam room, it is now a muddied title as well....even for those who have delivered babies."
STANLEY NEUSTADTER,"I write to compliment your doctorate dilution piece in today's WSJ, and to share a compatible anecdote.

	Years back, a fellow appeared regularly on TV talk shows and news programs to passionately announce the discovery of some dreadful, often cancer-related, threat to health from one foodstuff or other. He was introduced as ""Dr. Michael Jacobson"". 

	Because he was so confidently addressing heath related matters, everyone assumed he was an MD. In fact, he had a PhD but no formal medical training whatever. He used the honorific to lend artificial authority to his terrifying food scares.

	One evening,  he was a guest on Evans & Novak. The first question out of Novak's mouth was (more or less), ""You're not a medical doctor, are you""? Well, you could have heard the air rush out of Jacobson's balloon when he had to admit that he wasn't. As far as I know, even though he remained in the food safety field, he never again presented himself as ""Dr"". Michael Jacobson.

charles courtney,See Jacques Barzun's remarks on the value of the PhD in his classic Teacher in America (1954). He thought the Columbia School of Education was a kitchen that should be drowned.  He was skeptical of the value of the PhD as it relates to the humanities. He also referenced Henry James the PhD Octopus for harsh remarks on the degree's value. 
Thomas Walker,"Your article on Dr. Biden is demeaning both to women and to those students who have strived, often at considerable expense, to attain a PhD. At this time of crises over both a pandemic and a divisive response to the upcoming Presidential handover, this petty opinion is not going to help our nation to move forward."
Diana Dahl,"After the horrendous four years of attacks on Melania... now we must ""move forward"" and say nary a word about Jill? That is.... funny..."
Sharon Stout,"""After the horrendous four years of attacks on Melania...  ""   You mean Michelle Obama, don't you?  But it was eight years.   She was a marvel of grace.   ""When they go low, we go high.""Melania?   I lost interest in her after she was photographed at a detention center wearing that jacket with ""I don't care, do U?""  written in big letters on the back.   "
Diana Dahl,"The detention centers that Obama established in 2014, but I am sure you were only enraged at and noticed between 2016 -2020? You realize you voted for the guy that was involved with that decision, right? Women are so illogical."
Sharon Stout,"""Women are so illogical.""  Right back at you.   Defend Melania's  jacket, Diana Dahl?   "
Ted Torphy,"And eight years of hectoring Michelle, Hillary, and Nancy. Happily, Laura was pretty much left alone."
Diana Dahl,"All the negative comments are coming in from the libs who saw this highlighted on Twitter just now.Sorry, if women want to be ""equal""... you gotta take the punches the same way a man does."
MARK GEARY,"I'm not a lib, but where are the punches directed at the titles of Dr. Martin Luther King, Dr. Henry Kissinger, Dr. Albert Einstein, et al.? I've never seen anybody questioning their honorifics.Should we call those men ""Marty,"" ""Hank,"" and ""Al?"""
Diana Dahl,"If you read the article, he's pointing out how diluted and meaningless the ""Dr."" title is nowadays - just about anyone can get one now. And since you can, drop the ""Dr."" garbage."
MARK GEARY,"I did read the article, and I disagree with Mr. Epstein's premise. People with Ph.D.'s have earned their titles, and the respect that goes with it."
Mac Moore,"GEARY writes, 'Dr. Martin Luther King, Dr. Henry Kissinger, Dr. Albert Einstein, et al.?""You mean, after they were recognized as the world's experts in their endeavors?  Before that, I don't think any of them were called doctor in public.  Did I miss where Jill has been recognized as equals to those three?"
Jonathan Freeman-Coppadge,"A long-time subscriber to NYT, I decided to buy WSJ because I value rigorous thought and discussion, even from conservative perspectives. I'm disappointed to have found none in Mr. Epstein's opinion, but I'm more concerned about what this piece says about editorial standards at the Journal."
Bryce Lowder,"The opinion pages are often full of lies and contempt, but the news side of the organization is still good. "
Jonathan Delaney,"Funny enough you have people taking the opinion side as gospel and the news side as fake, which is typical for some people."
Paul Randelman,"Should a dentist not be referred to as ""Doctor? How about a podiatrist? A veterinarian? A chiropractor? I doubt they have delivered babies."

Diana Dahl,"This took guts - Bravo!And by the way... very true. If many of us are being honest, we rolled our eyes at the ""Dr. Jill Biden"" thing anyway."
robert whalen,"Any graduate degree in education is pretty much a fraud. Have you ever reviewed what is needed to receive an M.Ed?  Every third-tier college in America offers one because of the lucrative demand: recipients who are public school teachers get a salary bump. If you want to attend an entire course on bulletin board design then you should also seek such a degree.I have a dear, dear friend who received her PhD in education from a flagship state university and explained of the staff, ""I am surrounded by idiots.""One might as well ""earn"" a doctorate in astrology or phrenology."
ELLEN MANNOS,I was just thinking the other day how these M.Ed's teaching my grandchildren remote learning are insulting - talking down to the children.  Sat through some sessions while babysitting - I felt bad for my kids - and they kind of new the teachers had no clue in part to what they were doing - technology wise - perhaps they felt defensive in their own ignorance.  Then  I thought we need real working career professionals teaching the following: Journalists - good one's teaching English - language artsAccountants Finance majors teaching MathHistorians teaching HistoryTechnology - Computer Science Majors  - teaching Computers******I could go on - elementary curriculum needs complete restructuring. A degree in education is useless!! And the teacher unions need to be excoriated! The whole thing is disturbing! 
Dane Leone,Yeah this is the end.  You lost a subscriber and probably many more.  Regardless of anyones political beliefs - referring to a highly educated woman as 'kiddo' is beyond anything that should pass editorial.  I have not subscribed to this news organization for years to read journalism at the grade of the NYPost.  Best of luck kiddos!
charles courtney,"Jacques Barzun author of Teacher in America said the Columbia School of Education was a kitten that should be drowned. He was skeptical of value of PhD as it relates to the humanities. See Henry James, The PhD Octopus."
Mac Moore,"Leone writes, "" referring to a highly educated woman as 'kiddo' Holy Cow!  The author didn't invent that moniker.  The author is repeating what Joe calls Jill.  It is the whole idea of the article, focusing in on the ""doctor"" title.   Lighten up on the melodrama."
Shalimar Manalili,I don't anybody should be able to use a a term of endearment or a nickname . That's highly inappropriate! You're being disingenuous. 
Marc Satterwhite,"Other people are not welcome to use my wife and my pet names for each other, even if they know them.  It was a not-so-subtle slam, as was the whole article."
D D,oh please....that's what her hub calls her!  But you're right: leave. This Journal requires a much higher IQ.
Molly Doyle,"Pointless, ill-informed and offensive.  I'm a new subscriber and the opinion desk has just lost credibility with me.  Hopefully the news room has better priorities in what it prints.  "
Thomas Cutler,"Terrible article and candidly I am appalled that the Editors at the WSJ would allow this to be printed.  I can't believe that they would publish such garbage.  As a Ph.D. biochemist or anyone who had paid the price with time, sweat and tears to earn the degree, it's my choice whether I choose to call myself a doctor, not someone else."
robert whalen,"The title ""Doctor"" embarrasses me when people so address me and I consistently told my students  I was ""Mr."" and not ""Dr.""  The school where I taught wasn't helpful because it insisted students use the phony title because it impressed parents.The us of PhD after one's name is valid, I suppose, to identify oneself as The author of a scholarly paper -- it alerts the reader that the writer has minimal scholarly qualifications.I never knew a fellow grad student to faint at his orals although I did know at least one who became catatonic. And, all of us learned at least two languages, completed an M.A. and qualifying exams, pursued years of seminar work, sat for our orals, completed a dissertation (mine was 400 pages and is still referenced) and defended it. But, the only thing needed to obtain a PhD is perseverance. Otherwise, it really is nothing special. (The initials actually stand for ""Piled Higher and Deeper.)An honorary FUD? Laughable!"
Bill Herman,"The English language does not possess the requisite profanity that would be an appropriate response to this drivel.No woman, nor any decent man, should ever again give this manchild the time of day."
Tyler M,"This is a really embarrassing article WSJ, and not worthy of the price I pay for a subscription.I just called to try and cancel my subscription, but unfortunately customer service is currently closed.For anyone who doesn't know, you also apparently can't cancel online which is also abusive to customers in my opinion, as it is a clear decision to prevent people from being able to cancel. Anyways look forward to my call to cancel on Monday."
will crutchfield,"The column could at least have been used to explain the conventional use of honorifics, with which the author appears unfamiliar.  It has long been usual in American academia not to use ""Dr.,"" but to use ""Prof."" when one attains the rarer rank of full professorship. For the university community, ""Dr."" generally means M.D., not Ph.D. Lawyers have doctorates too, but tend (or used to) to favor the quaint designation ""Esq.,"" listed after the surname.  However, in communities less tied to university customs, in particular among the clergy, there has long been greater use of ""Dr."" for earned but non-medical doctorates. It also varies internationally. In Germany until quite recently the honorific was commonly used for all earned doctorates.  In other words, it's all a matter of custom and tradition. Or, in this sniveling whine of a column, a matter of finding a random way to insult someone whose presence you resent. "
Mac Moore,"crutchfield writes, ""Or, in this sniveling whine of a column, a matter of finding a random way to insult someone whose presence you resent.""No where in the article does the author say anything about resenting Biden.  You are projecting your bias, not any fact.In nearly every society, a medical professional is an important role in every day life.  And, their title is an important recognition as knowing where the fire department and police departments reside.  So, we generally do not recognize monikers like Doctor, casually.  When, the cry goes out, ""is there a doctor in the house?!"", they aren't looking to take inventory or seek a nearby academic.So, when an academic insists that others call them doctor outside of their employment, it is deemed as petty, selfish and superficial.  "
will crutchfield,"If you can't tell he resents Biden just because he didn't ""say anything about resenting"" her, bless your heart, but there are other ways to get the feeling across."
Mac Moore,"crutchfield writes, ""If you can't tell he resents Biden just because he didn't ""say anything about resenting"" her, bless your heart, but there are other ways to get the feeling across.""That's a lot of hate you carry.  It isn't healthy.  Take care."
Bruce Phillips,"Disgraceful article. An honorary degree is meaningless academically--it is an honor, or a fundraising pitch.  Jill, you are, will be, and deserve to be, Dr. Biden.  WSJ, how could you print such nonsense and rubbish?  If this article is about the deterioration of PHDs, so be it, but leave Jill Biden out of it.  I am just appalled by this, and by the misogyny in this article."
Jack Hopkins,"This is outrageous, even for the Journal Opinion section. Perhaps Mr. Epstein should drop the ""Author"" from his descriptive and go with something closer to the truth about who is really is - which cannot be printed here.I do appreciate the heads up on avoiding absolutely anything else with this fool's name on it."
Alex Liebetrau,This pettiness makes it to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal? Does anyone review the commentary anymore and checks it for at least a minimum of thought and insight? Ridiculous.
Abigail Hope,"I can barely contain myself from telling Joseph Epstein, Joe, Kiddo, just what he should call himself.  As an educator who has continued her own schooling, and is working now on just my second masters degree, anyone who has earned a Phd has earned the right to put a Dr. in front of her name.  "
reed arvin,"In the long history of snark, this is perhaps the snarkiest. And I have 2 of Epstein's books on the bookshelf. This was ill-considered, to put it mildly."
RICHARD OBRIEN,"This is embarrassing, WSJ. "
James Busby, I cannot support a news organization that peddles in such pettiness. At least education is valued by Jill Biden. You've lost a subscriber. 
Nava Balsam,This article is horrifying. How could you publish something like this? What did you hope to gain?
Carol Hernandez,"WSJ Editors, this editorial is so hostile and clueless in terms of race, gender, and class that it reads like a parody of itself. I am seriously disappointed that you chose to run this and help promote this outdated worldview. No one even asked his opinion in the first place and he wants to sell his book. WSJ, you got played!"
Kevin Sorrentino,"""this editorial is so hostile and clueless in terms of race, gender, and class""This criticism has no absolutely no meaning.  "
Brian Bittner,"When revisiting the article, I can find multiple text snippets that support the critique."
Juan Rodriguez,Explain please.  Break it down for us. 
Lila Kate Cooley,The sheer amount of time Mr. Epstein spends talking about honorary doctorates (which Jill Biden does not have) here says it all. 
jake dacey,"This fellow gets paid to write and teach others about writing?  Send him back to school.  And have him take courses that include logic, critical thinking and essay writing.  Clearly he is deficient in these areas.  And make the school  a community college.  He will develop  appreciation for the value they provide to our economy and society despite the many challenges for both students and faculty. "
Kathleen McCook,"This from the man who called himself ""Aristides"" for so many years. Just stop."
LUCY P SEWARD,That Joseph Epstein and the WSJ deem this piece worthy of publication speaks volumes about the author and the publication and nothing about Dr. Biden.
Stuart Newman,"My wife is a Doctor of Audiology, but never uses her title unless she is corresponding/emailing in a professional venue.  In fact she gets annoyed with me whenever I mention it even if we are in a medical setting.  IMHO earned titles (i.e. not the honorific type) are entirely up to the holder regarding deciding when to use them; others can think what they will.Having stated the above, I believe the author does make a valid point regarding the potential dilution of the title ""Doctor.""  I never hear attorneys or pharmacists (most of whom have Pharm Ds these days) use the term, and there is a pretty large difference between having a PhD in STEM and one in Education.  As more and more fields/occupations engender the title Doctor, perhaps the title itself becomes lessened."
P H,"The author's point is lost in his frank hostility towards Dr. Biden. This is a political diatribe, not a discussion of professionalism."
Laura Moody,"As a woman with a PhD in engineering who works with several EdDs I'm really interested in understanding on what basis you conclude  that the fact that ""there is a very large difference between a degree in STEM and one in education"" (stop the presses - we've discovered that different  professions require different skill sets!) means that one is more worthy of acknowledgment than the other -   both the PhD and the EdD are terminal degrees in their respective fields and entitle those who earned them to use the honorific that comes with the degree. Dr. Biden is a working educator and has the right to be addressed using the standard honorific of her profession. Thankfully, it is not the purview of narrow-minded chauvinists to decide who has that right. "
Patricia Monaster,"Epstein is a dinosaur. This is apparent by his line, ""A wise man once said that no one should call himself 'Dr.' unless he has delivered a child."" HIMSELF/HE? I bet he's murder with respect to gender pronouns, and I bet he's got definite opinions about THOSE! By dinosaur Joe's logic, Mr. Joe Biden shouldn't use the honorific of PRESIDENT because Donald has all but destroyed the high respect that title once held. The arduous rigors involved in obtaining the highest office in our country were rendered a sham by a rich, reality TV host.  Dr. Jill Biden is an accomplished person in her own right, and all the work she has put forth to earn the titles she carries today shouldn't be shelved because she will have the title of First Lady. "
John Boeckeler,"Epstein the sexist dinosaur with those stone age pronouns.  Zie should have written, ""A wise person once said that no one should call zieself 'Dr.' unless zie has delivered a child.""  ""First Lady"" is a sexist term as well.  It's  a condescending put down intended to reinforce feminine stereotypes and has no place in modern usage.  Dr. Biden should make it clear that ""First Lady"" will have no place in zir White House.  From now on it's ""First Mate"", ""First Womyn"", or ""First Doctor""."
Romeo Quintana,This Epstein guy should be thankful for having an avenue for his idiocy. 
David Steele,Have you printed the H. L. Mencken quote yet?
Robert Sweetman,"Sounds like someone has ""degree-envy"" , Mr BA in English ! Out-educated and by a woman ! My word, what this world has come to?  What a shock you are in your 9th decade!  "
Cynthia Jackson,"How did the Wall Street Journal decide to publish such drivel?  This is disgusting, condescending, and blatantly misogynistic.I have a PhD, and I am professionally licensed as a psychologist. My degree was granted 30 years ago, with rigorous academic requirements.  I am completely comfortable with the use of the term ""Dr.""  I respect anyone's hard work in obtaining a doctorate.I don't know one of my friends, colleagues, or acquaintances who are medical doctors who object to this. In fact, they often call themselves clinicians or providers.Dr. Biden,  I wish you the very best in both your role as first lady and in your ongoing career. We are grateful to have you."
KATHLEEN BLANCHARD,This opinion should be stowed long before Dr. Biden stows her well earned degree in an important educational topic.
Diana Ross,"That went down well, eh kiddo?  What was the WSJ thinking printing this sexist claptrap? I don't call myself Dr because I don't practice in the field of my doctorate though I do sometimes precisely because there are such non-entities as the author walking the earth.  Dr Biden is a working educator with a PhD, a much better women than he will ever be a man, and deserves the honorific.   Haven't we had enough nonsense in the past few weeks that we can't go back to basic respect where it is due? "
MICHELLE ANDERSON,"This is abhorrent. She earned the title ""Dr."" as much as anyone with an MD, PhD, DO, DVM, etc. She can use it if she wishes. You wouldn't be arguing this if she was a man. "
robert whalen,"Baloney.A doctorate in education is a mild degree that exists mainly to permit its holder to advance up the salary ladder in public education. It is not comparable to what is required of one to earn an MD.Have you ever looked at a PhD dissertation in physical education? You could slip a copy of most of these under the door of a bank vault. There are several other fields in which a doctorate is almost an embarrassment.I have an acquaintance who holds a ""PhD"" from the University of Phoenix -- he ""earned"" it in one year. Now that we are all into remote learning, do you think he has a valid doctorate?I wish Mrs. Biden well."
Diana Ross,"That's Dr Biden to you.  And she has spent her life helping underserved kids rise in life.  What have you done lately?  She continues to teach despite never having to because of who she is.  Who are you, Rob, Bob, Bo, Bobert?  Names matter and a woman can decide herself who she calls herself, thank you just as much as you can. Just look at the number of elitist, unjustified preening comments from those who hide behind other degrees  in these comments and indeed the author. "
robert whalen,"I spent twenty years teaching in tough inner city schools after I retired from business and only quit because, at age 74, I was no longer up to the job. I was the only white person in the school for many years.I hid with my students against a wall with the door locked and the lights off when we had an active shooter in the school. It was -- far and away -- the best job I ever had.If MRS. Biden has been actually at such a job then I admire her."
Walter Baile,I really like the reporting of the WSJ but the editorial and opinion sections seem often better suited for Mad Magazine or the Onion.
Tim O'Brien,This from the gentleman who literally wrote the book on Envy.   
Myka Estes,"Oat milk-kiddo. Any chance you might drop the ""milk"" from your name? ""Oat milk"" sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your milk is, I believe, non-mammary. A wise man once said that no liquid should call itself ""milk"" unless stolen from farm animal to feed a human, or squeezed from magnesium, which is a legitimate chemical element. Think about it, oat milk, and forthwith drop the milk.Twit."
Robert Altman,I can't believe you would run such a shameful piece. 
Lauren Parlow,This is disgusting and sexist and I'm ashamed to be a subscriber. 
Brooke Bredbeck,You don't have to be! There are good journals out there that don't belittle educated women. I cancelled today.
P H,"Try AP, Reuters, or NPR. Much more centrist and less emotional."
Gary Katz,This column is petty and almost completely irrelevant. The WSJ  used to have a higher quality of journalistic standard than this opinion. From a quick reading of reader's comments it's obvious most of you are denying the political reality of our country:  4 years of Trump was enough.
robert haggard,"Thank you Joe. I see the obligatory Democrats have chimed in denouncing you and the opinion piece. I also have wondered how someone with a PhD in education can have the nerve to continually pompously pass themselves off as DOCTOR. I probably have as many credit hours as Dr Jill and I only have a bachelors. Now I was dubbed Dr Bob at my last place of employment by a young engineer who I took under my wing to help him navigate the waters of our discipline. I subsequently became know as Dr Bob throughout the office but no one, especially myself, ever took it seriously. "
Kathleen Kettles,That' s because you didn't earn the degree. Sour grapes.
Walter Baile,"I also have wondered how someone with a PhD in education can have the nerve to continually pompously pass themselves off as DOCTORI think you may have offended many educators across the country who worked hard for their Ed D and , unlike yourself, labored under the challenges of writing a dissertation. Also, unlike yourself,  they earned their title and do take it seriously."
robert haggard,I earned the degree I've got which is a BSEE. What's yours?
Rebecca Corrin,"""Jill Biden should think about dropping the honorific, which feels fraudulent, even comic.""Now Joseph, sweetpea, what feels fraudlent or comic to you is really your issue. However the First Lady wishes to be addressed is fine by me. It is her name and her title."
Howard Huddleston,"Most of the posts I've seen below take a dim view of this article, but there is a definite level of embarrassment for someone running about in public calling themselves something that would be totally misleading to the uninitiated.  When you're First Lady, make that in spades.  I mean, Whoopie Goldberg thinks Jill Biden is qualified to be Surgeon General!  Parading an honorific like this, outside of your professional environment, just makes a person seem smaller."
Brian Bittner,It might be the public that needs to do the adjusting here. Seems to be the consensus of replies in this comments section.
Michael Trudeau,"My third grade teacher had a doctorate and would get frustrated if someone used Mrs. instead of Dr. when addressing her including any students.  And rightly so.  If I had worked hard in my field and earned a doctorate, I would definitely want people to use the correct honorific to acknowledge my achievements.  Mr. Epstein, you just come across as another man who is threatened by an accomplished woman.  I can't wait to hear why you feel threatened by Kamala Harris in your next piece, but even moreso, I can't wait for the WSJ to never publish any of your drivel again."
Kevin Kuzia,"This has gotten completely ridiculous with the Opinion side of the WSJ. I thought it was bad to see the Editorial Board continuing to claim election fraud the same day its own reporters reported there was a complete lack of evidence on this point. But this? This is petty, unprofessional and completely embarrassing. Ed.D is a doctorate and she did the work to earn it. It wasn't an ""honorary"" and the author did little but dismiss her thesis based on the title of it alone.I loathe cancel culture (which revolves around eliminating voices over single events and mistakes), but I'm cancelling my WSJ subscription today because of a steady decline in any sense of journalistic integrity of this Opinion side. Glad to see I'm not alone."
Alexander Halavais,"I'm curious why the WSJ refers to the author as ""Mr."" Epstein, rather than just ""Joe"" or ""sweetie."" Perhaps because it--despite publishing this misogynistic anti-intellectual claptrap--recognizes the role of respect in public communication.No, an honorary doctorate was never worth more than the paper it was written on--that it why it is contrasted with an ""earned"" doctorate: the earning part. To liken Dr. Biden's earned degree to anything ""fraudulent"" is to misunderstand the term. Mr. Epstein (to bestow a degree of respect he seems unwilling to provide others) is wholly unqualified to assess the quality of someone's dissertation. I suppose in an era during which people without medical training regularly dispense lethal medical advice, and those without scientific backgrounds seem to think they better understand science than working scientists (you know, with those once-honorable Ph.D.s), it is unsurprising that Mr. Epstein has such high self-regard.- Prof. Alex"
Kevin Grant,"Others have probably made this comment by now, but I haven't read through all of the other 714 responses. ""Doctorate"" derives from the Latin verb ""to teach"" and has been used as an academic title for about 800 years. Only more recently, and mostly in former members of the Commonwealth, did it become common practice to use ""Doctor"" as a courtesy title for medical practitioners. In my family, we are incredibly proud of those who have earned their doctorates, knowing how hard they worked and the level of expertise they have achieved. This opinion piece is an embarrassment to a publication that should hold itself to higher journalistic standards, even in the editorial section."
Matthew Zich,"I cannot think of anything I've read in my 10 year subscription to the WSJ that more evidences the smug, entitled, out of touch good ol' boys club that the opinion page represents than this article. "
Gary Brennaman,"So you are given oped privileges at a prestigious national news outlet and in a time of crisis choose to write this sniveling, whiny essay. As Donald Trump would say ""What a Loser!"""
Paula Penn-Nabrit,"I think this is an example of frustrated impotence in print, beginning with a stunning admission accompanied by not the slightest twinge of irony, ""I taught at Northwestern University for 30 years without a doctorate or any advanced degree.""  Bragging about opportunity without credentials, i.e., unearned privilege, is how the reader surmises the writer's status as unconscious, Caucasian-white, and male. The conclusion is even more revelatory. ""If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try 'rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.'"" How challenging it must be to enter the fray with all the opportunities inherent in a  republic built upon the intersection of patriarchy and systems of white supremacy and  yet  emerge at the end with little more than feeble expressions of acrimony and envy. The frustration of being eclipsed by Black women must feel like impotence in the face of decades of  deep desire to perform.  

"
David Kinnear,"This is the most pathetic bit of whining that I have read in a long time. That is saying a lot, considering this is the Opinions section of the WSJ. "
Steven Allen,"Of all the legitimate concerns faced by our country now, THIS is what the WSJ thinks is important?  This is beyond embarrassing and disgusting to promote this utter garbage.  "
Brian Bittner,"The word doctor has latin roots, ""docere"" - to teach.  Used widely to distinguish those educating scholars during the Renaissance.The medical community started using the phrase ""doctor"" as a pragmatic means to establish trust between educated medical practitioners and their patients. So we now call the ""educated"" doctors, as long as it's refined to medical practice, while the ""educators"" use of the title is assumed to be application of untamed vanity. "
Christopher Mortimer,"What kind of garbage is this? Individuals that spend years in higher education by obtaining their undergraduate, graduate, and finally doctorates degree deserve the right to acknowledge the work they put in to become an expert in their field. Lawyers, MDs, and PHDs, deserve the title in their names for the time they spent perfecting their craft."
Jessica Mendez,"Why would the WSJ even publish this? This is a reputable organized publication. What is this? What is the purpose of this? Because from my seat, the only purpose I see is to continue to minimize women's achievements. "
Geoff Lawrence,"This article is right on point.  Those with academic doctorates  should only use their title  in their academic setting.  Medical doctors must practice their trade wherever and whenever a medical  requirement exists(which is everywhere).  And by the way, I dare say becoming a medical doctor and maintaining certifications far exceeds that of a academic doctorate.Although I legally am able to preface my name with my retired military rank(Colonel), I believe it only appropriate to use in a military environment.  And again, I would say having to go through 5 promotion , 2 command selection   and 2 professional education  boards  exceeds any PHD requirement.  Jill needs to drop the Dr.!"
P H,"""On point""? You think it appropriate to belittle a figure as a ""kiddo"" because of a widespread cultural phenomenon? She is one of thousands who use their title like that. This is a political diatribe aimed at minimizing a woman's accomplishment because she is married to the Democrat president-elect. Wake up, colonel."
Lynn McLinden,"    ""And by the way, I dare say becoming a medical doctor and maintaining certifications far exceeds that of a academic doctorate."" 

As a categorical statement here, Colonel, I think with this you've ventured outside your area of expertise.

Earning a PhD in any ""hard"" discipline (including the STEM fields and many others) from a strong American university can be, and usually is, at least the equal of earning an MD, and as for ""maintaining"" it, the requirements of such in a professorial career track at a strong American university far exceed the rigors of maintaining an MD in general clinical practice.

Having said that, to be clear, among American PhD degrees generally, I agree there is a huge variation in the effort and intellectual accomplishment involved in earning them. In this, they are very far from all being equal. PS By the way, Jill Biden's degree is an EdD, which is an entirely different animal, as pointed out by many posters here already."
Andrea Hess,"You are asking a woman to be addressed by her title ""Madam First Lady"", which she holds because of her husband's accomplishments instead of being addressed by the title Dr., which she holds because of her own accomplishments? This is 2021 and not the 1950ies. "
Taffeta Wood,"How dare a woman use a title she's earned. She should use the title that communicates her true importance...that earned through marriage. Also, let's address her as a child. Yes it's an opinion piece. And yes the opinions of the writer are both anti-intellectual and anti-feminist. To which the only thing I can do is stop reading or subscribing to the WSJ. So...I will go do that right now. Bye y'all."
Dan Caulfield,I can't believe this organization published this.
Justin Vempala,What a small man to be so pressed and dismissive of an accomplished woman
MARK SOWA,Does it not cross your mind that he's defending the prestige of people who have earned real challenging academic degrees - many of which are also women?Or are you so sexist that you don't realize that women are medical doctors and have PhD's in real sciences like physics?Her degree is not impressive and not even useful - it has nothing to do with her being a woman.
P H,"Not useful? Perhaps not to you, but EdS degrees are essential in guiding the education of our youth. I'm not sure which high horse you rode in on, but maybe you and the author can ride the same horse out, back into the 1950s where you belong."
SCOTT KIEFER, you don't think an Ed.D is challenging? please share your academic history. what advanced degrees do you hold?
Justin Vempala,Appreciating the achievements of one does not diminish the value of others. Honorifics are not a zero sum game. Sorry you are unimpressed; I can't imagine the weight of the accomplishments you must bear. 
Matt McCafferty,This is a stunningly bad take with no real purpose. 
charles ross,I see the Wall Street Journal Op-Ed section is plumbing new depths of pettiness. Absolutely pathetic.
Bruce Raben,"I agree, for the most part, with ""Dr."" Epstein.  i do believe there are old school Phd's in domains other than the hard sciences that require years of research, scholarship, thesis and defense that can lead to ""Dr."" being appropriate in an academic context.  As regards your advice to the future first lady, who seems terrific, I agree; she should lose the Dr."
Diana Ross,Why?  She is still going to be teaching.  This Dr. with a hard science degree disagrees.  She did the work and then some in the field and she deserves the title.  Who made you the gatekeeper? And who are any of us but her to opine on this?  
Brian Page,"Epstein is not the only one at fault, the WSJ should be held accountable too. I can read this frivolous nonsense for free on Infowars or Breitbart, I shouldn't have to pay for it. Either the WSJ does something to address these misogynistic elitist nonsense, or I'll cancel my subscription. "
Scot Safon,Agreed.  Was shocked and saddened by this piece. Will not be renewing my subscription if these are the standards.  
David Murchison,"I have noticed conservatives are in the habit of demanding apologies from liberals when their tender feelings are hurt. On that basis, in the interest of equity, I demand an apology for this tripe from Joseph Epstein, and a further apology from the WSJ Editors for publishing it.I'm not holding my breath, but that's my demand."
Kimberly Gavagan,"""Kiddo?"" Seriously? The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed for publishing this misogynistic piece of garbage, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement.  It will always be one step forward, two steps back for women as long as people like Mr. Epstein are given a stage to post their outdated viewpoints. "
Virginia Child,"This is ridiculous.  The author conflates honorary doctorates with earned ones, denigrates the work required for an Ed.D. , suggests that because her degree came from Delaware, it's worthless, and casts aspersions on the title of her dissertation.  And the Wall Street Journal thinks this is worthwhile?  Oh yes, he also calls Dr. Biden, ""kiddo"".  That one word alone should have told you the author was writing out of his prejudices, and raised warning flags for the WSJ.  Of course, study of the work Dr. Biden does, given that it's mostly been at community colleges couldn't possibly be important  So Dr. Biden should drop the title, because:  she's a woman; she teaches at worthless schools; it's only an Ed.D; it came from the U of Delaware; she didn't have to learn Greek or even Latin.....  What a bunch of hooey.  I'm disappointed in the WSJ."
Katie Scott,Thank you!!  My sentiments exactly.  Dr Biden EARNED her degree!
Dapo F,"I'm not one for the ""cancel culture"" shenanigans, but I am canceling my WSJ subscription today. I have had a subscription to the WSJ for over a decade. I really enjoyed reading this publication because it provided a counterbalance to the other media outlets I follow. Also, I have deeply appreciated the in depth reporting their team provides on major business events of the day.However, as a subscriber, I have sadly watched the quality of their opinion pieces devolve over time - especially in the last few years. This piece  is a new low and I can not continue to fund this particular type of manure. "
Brooke Bredbeck,"Agreed, there is a difference between seeking out cognitive diversity (which is super necessary) and endorsing crackpots. One deserves my money; the other makes me complicit in their delusions. Also canceled. "
Bruce James,"Somewhat understandable coming from someone who couldn't possibly put in the work or the years it takes to earn a PhD, and also reflects his ignorance."
Daniel Bukszpan,"So Dr. Jill Biden is a doctor, because she earned a doctorate, which makes her an accomplished person who earned her credential. Meanwhile, Joseph Epstein is some crank who got his op-ed published. Which one of these two people will be remembered in a month? (HINT: Not Joseph Epstein.)"
Will Stevens,"This reeks of so much elitism and sexism that a person, who in good faith, thought they were doing a good thing would have to be beyond delusional. Epstein simultaneously preaches about a lack of quality education, while displaying their complete lack of any education themselves. No rational person should demand that a life not lived in their image is a wrongly lived life. Yet, Epstein does and finishes it off by asserting that Dr. Jill should settle for being housewife to the President. To say that this is an article that did not deserve publishing would be an understatement. Epstein and the editors of the Journal should be ashamed and reflect on what ideals they want their platform to uphold. "
Tanya Sanchez,"I'm curious if the author is aware that Dr. Jill Biden, soon to be our First Lady, is going to continue teaching.  "
Diana Ross,She is I believe.
ALEXANDRA JARISLOWSKY,"Even Julius Erving would find this article insane.  Come on WSJ, this is pretty bad....regardless of the obvious side of the aisle you've recently buttered your bread with.  Where is the WSJ of my earlier years? Sad."
Cameron Haines,The Journal should be ashamed of themselves for putting out this article. Blatantly sexist and misogynistic. Mr. Epstein should spend his time on more pressing matters than worrying about the title in front of Jill Biden's name. 
Nichole Parker,This shouldn't have been published or written. Good to know that Mr. Epstein is a sexist old man reliving his glory days and privilege. 
Scott Willis,"Wow, Mr. Epstein seems like a bitter, frail-minded relic. He almost seems jealous of Biden's accomplishment. I don't care what she or anyone else uses as long as it was earned.And for the editors of the Wall Street Journal to endorse this (as you know they would never publish a similar piece by a liberal about a conservative - say, Seb Gorka) shows how unprofessional, childish, and hyper-partisan they have become."
Juan Rodriguez,Epstein just proved that it's amateur hour at the Wall Street Journal.  
Shala Burroughs,Agreed. It has never been easier for me to think about cancelling a subscription in my life. 
Blandy Fisher,Canceling mine right now. So tired of giving WSJ the benefit of the doubt. 
Brian Page,I'm considering the same.
Allen Speight,"Likewise.  If there's no response from Taranto or the editorial team on this, you will see my subscription canceled in short order.  Not a PC matter, simple respect for people is what's called for here."
Brooke Bredbeck,me too! just cancelled. liberating.
Brooke Bredbeck,"Excellent alternatives include FT, Economist, and NYT. Wanted a center right publication but WSJ really dove off the deep end in recent years. Economist and FT fill that need decently enough for me."
Mac Moore,"Bredbeck writes, ""Wanted a center right ......Economist and FT fill that need decently enough for me.""Both, are center Left.  When was the last time either endorsed a GOP for president?  Maybe, your real concern is that you prefer center-left company.  Here, you get a mix, so a lot of articles will cheer you while others will disgust you.  Economist / FT won't do that."
Richard Seesel,"I'll look forward to Mr. Epstein's companion piece next week, criticizing Sebastian Gorka's use of the same honorarium (""Doctor"") because he also earned a PhD. And I assume Mr. Epstein will address him as ""kiddo."" too. "
Brooke Bredbeck,"As someone who holds an actual MD, I don't have any issues with her calling herself ""Dr"" -- in fact, I find it perfectly appropriate and deserving. So why should anyone care what some kook with an honorary degree thinks? Just got off the phone and cancelled my subscription. Good riddance. My conscience is cleaner knowing none of my money is supporting this trash. If  any woman reads this and gets any notion that you shouldn't own your educational accomplishments: don't listen to this rando. He speaks for a bygone era and, just like Trump and his cronies, is going to go out with a whimper soon enough. Keep fighting the good fight. "
MARK LASKA,"If this is what passes as a relevant op-ed then you have definitely lost your way. I won't even address the author's words because when you read the first sentence the only appropriate response should have been: NO. You owe America an apology for this garbage. You disparage every person who has dedicated themselves to pursuing higher education and advanced degrees.  You insult every PhD out there and every university dedicated to conferring doctorates of philosophy, and you demean women in particular by giving this author any column inches for his drivel.  Really WSJ this is just despicable. "
GEOFFREY FULLER,"I'm really confused by this OpEd - is it meant to be a tongue-in-cheek joke or are you serious?  Because if you are serious, you just alienated everyone who has their doctoral degree in any area of focus, who worked hard, and should be respected.  Some colleges tout that all of their professors have a doctorate in their fields, and that speaks volumes.  So please tell me this was satire, because otherwise you should be ashamed of yourself, kiddo."
Thomas Adamowski,"Although there is some truth in the claim that the Ph.D. has lost in rigor over the past 3 decades, still, Jill Biden earned the degree; and there is no need for Mr. Epstein to become all huffy about it in what is an obvious attempt to embarrass her.  There is also some hint of the reverse snobbery that marks literary people who become successful college teachers sans Ph.D.  And while it's true that many teachers in American universities eschew ""Dr."" this is because, in numerous places, now that everyone must have a Ph.D. to teach in the universities, more prestige attaches to the title Professor.  It's harder to get that title.  The Catholic Church hasn't, by the way, agreed about the ""bush league"" status of ""Dr.""  It has over 30 some ""Doctors of the Church,"" including Aquinas, Hildegarde, Augustine, and other eminences.  I hope they don't start calling them Mr and Ms.By the way, I assume Mr. Epstein has an article somewhere slapping Dr. Kissinger on the wrist also?"
David Bakker,"My best friend in high school (we're still close) did a research internship at NIH.  He loved it and decided to pursue the work at his undergraduate college.  Upon graduation he debated whether to obtain an MD or a PHD to continue his research- one or the other was pretty much mandatory.   When he finally opted for the MD I asked him why.  He said, ""The PHD is more work, takes longer and pays a LOT less."""
James Warren,Hard to know where to start. Let's just say the article should've never been written. Once written WSJ was wrong to publish it. 
Paul Israel,"what a misogynistic, reductionist,  toxic, green with envy and disrespect opinion...  I knew what it is going to be about at 'kiddo'.   I read through, though, and haven't changed my opinion of the writer.  Toxic. "
Elizabeth Crowell,"How arrogant, sexist, and condescending. Dr. Jill Biden is an accomplished woman in her own right, regardless of her husband's many accomplishments.  I send my well wishes to to President-Elect and Dr. Biden."
Bruce Margolius,"Fifty years ago, I graduated from a then-prestigious Ivy League university (too woke now to have retained its reputation) where almost all of our professors, PhD or not, were addressed as Mr, Mrs, Miss, or Ms.  It was a form of reverse snobbery, I suppose, but it is one that Jill (and her media sycophants) would be well-advised to imitate.  She teaches at a community college, has written (with help) a couple of children's books, and is otherwise undistinguished intellectually.  She does support teachers' unions, though, in their quest to get paid more for doing less.  As a ""doctor,"" she's a quack."
Aderinsola Adesida,"Doctor is derived from the Latin word for teacher. When you get your doctorate in any field, you become a teacher or ""doctor"" in that field.  We  now have an association of Dr. and medicine, but that doesn't change the meaning. That's Dr. Jill Biden to you, whether you like it or not."
Anne Barnstead-Klos,"I'm not sure why I should care about Mr. Epstein's opinion regarding this topic. I cannot, however, overlook his condescending, patronizing, arrogant attitude. In my experience, the use of the honorific in the field of education is not at all rare. In fact, at least where I live, it's pretty common. Dr. Biden is, as I understand it, actively involved in her field still and will remain so as First Lady.  Show some respect. WSJ, please spare us time-wasters like this. "
Penny Cobey,"As someone with a Harvard Ph.D in English literature, I can confirm Epstein's statement that in the social sciences and humanities, calling oneself ""Dr"" is indeed considered bush-league at first-tier universities.  The practice is more common at community colleges or third-tier institutions where many faculty lack doctorates and those who have them wish to distinguish themselves."
Dana Eyre,"As someone with a Stanford Ph.D. in sociology, I can also confirm that at ""first-tier"" universities, the practice of name dropping your school is  also quite common.   "
Cecilia Pang,"Well this was certainly degrading to read. I guess this just goes to show how some people cannot deal with another's success and have to use belittling terms to de-credit hard work. This piece has greatly backfired. Rather than doing anything to Dr. Biden's character in fact, it has only demonstrated the whiny and pathetic character of Epstein. Only goes to demonstrate a true lack of confidence to be able to write this. What is the purpose? To demonstrate ignorance? An honorary doctorate is completely different than a D.Ed and bringing up your own background reaffirms such facts. Dr. Biden has much to be proud of while you Epstein, do not.  I understand each has their own opinion.... but just disappointed that such views like this still exist. Would you like it if people referred to you as ""kiddo""? Once was told that men who lacked true confidence often belittled strong intelligent women around them. Thanks for being a testament to that. "
Elaine Scully,"The outrage is hilarious.  I did assume that Jill Biden was an m.d., hearing her referred to constantly as ""Dr. Jill.""  It's a little bit over-promotional, but, yes, I suppose she can do that if she wants."
Mark Surfas,This is me unsubscribing and letting you know on the way out that it's for this column and no other reason.  
Catherine Young,Did he feel this way about Dr. Sebastian Gorka? 
Amy Swygert,"I wish I was surprised by this sexist and completely condescending attack on our incoming First Lady by a white male Conservative, but I'm not. The fact that he felt the need to take the time to write and submit this when our country is in the middle of a crisis of confidence in our democracy, not to mention an economic and public health crisis, is clearly a reflection of the author's own personal sense of inadequacy than anything else. Why the Wall Street Journal chose to print this is the bigger question. Yes, there is free speech, but some opinions are much more worthy of a public platform than this piece of garbage. "
Lauren Stiles,"There are many people who have worked hard to earn doctoral degrees in nursing, physical therapy, law, and many other fields. Actual physicians have no problem referring to these people by their Dr. titles. Cranky jealous old men who never bothered to earn any form of a doctorate can buzz off. "
Brian Ormiston,This oped says more about the writer than it does about Dr. Biden. Your wisest action is to bury the links and never speak of it again.
Lori Saldana,"As a recently retired community college IT professor, I have to admit: This is an interesting call to action... If the goal is to encourage  professional, educated women to stop subscribing to WSJ. "
Margaret Macdonald,I'm a Northwestern alumna and this is just the wrong note to strike. 
Adam Mair,"This sets a new low for WSJ opinion pieces.  This is garbage, why would you minimize anyone's Ph.D?  And calling her kiddo. . .I cannot believe WSJ published this.  This wouldn't qualify for a high-school opinion piece."
Dan Stifter,I'm embarrassed for subscribing to a publication that would print this trash.  She's got a doctorate and is entitled to the honorific.  Spending half the article conflating an honorary degree with Dr. Biden's actual degree is disingenuous at the very best.  Shame on everyone involved.
Shahid Ahsan,I was going to write a comment to discredit the author but I noted below that I need not as he has already been trashed.
Brooke Bredbeck,"I really was hoping that after Trump got thrown out of the WH the WSJ Editorial Board would start sounding saner. But here they are peddling misogyny--and with what purpose? To placate whiny Trump supporters? Enough. Grow a spine. This was the last straw for me because it shows they are only digging in their heels more after his loss. Cancelled my subscription today. If the Editorial Board comes to their senses and stops trying to completely undermine their journalists, maybe they'll get my money again. "
Haley Adams,"This has to be a satirical article. I'm laughing way too hard at this man's ""arguments"". "
Haley Adams,At least I got a chuckle out of it ;) 
James McDevitt,"I am truly surprised at the WSJ for publishing such an opinion article. For the record, l do not have a PhD. When a writer quotes ""a wise man once says..."" as the foundation of his argument I think one should fasten your seat belt because one is going to be in for quite a verbal rough ride. I feel sorry for the students of  Mr. Epstein who had to put up with such and arrogant and dogmatic person."
Jeremy Bowman,"I don't know what's worse - that the WSJ publishes this trash in the first place, or that it does so while 3,000 Americans a day are dying of Covid and Trump is literally trying to destroy the republic.There are more important issues at hand."
Stan Leaphart,"I am quite amused at the feigned outrage over Mr. Epstein referring to Mrs. Biden as ""kiddo."" This, from some of the same people who have referred to Mrs. Trump as everything from ""gold digger"" to ""porn star."". "
Diana Ross,But Dr Biden has not.  She was gracious to Karen Pence as befitted her role.  She deserves the title as a working educator who I'm sure does not need to work but does so to further the hopes of underserved students.
Bill Lee,"For those who object to this condescending, out-of-touch essay, feel free to write the author directly.  I did.j-epstein at northwestern dot edu"
James Stock,Get used to it. This election was stolen. 
David Bakker,"Not a responsive comment, just a knee jerk 'sez u'.  Mr. Stock, you had 16 posts yesterday and 33 the day before.  Maybe put that kind of effort more productively to work  and you could have your own PHD."
STEVEN HELLER,"Not according to the Supreme Court, or 'in the bag for Trump' attorney general Barr, or Republican officials who stand by their state's election count even though Trump lost there, or anyone not craving a dictator "
Juan Rodriguez,And how many fraudulent ballots are in the room with you right now James?
Yuri Vizitei,"Oh just so awkward and cringeworthy. It's bad enough that Mr. Epstein would write this (somehow the Sinefeld's George yelling ""Shrinkage"" come to mind). But that WSJ would actually publish it as an ""opinion"" is pretty sad commentary how far down the hill WSJ has traveled under the current ownership. "
Peter Hammond,"Polite reminder that the current first lady had a long career of taking her clothes off in front of a camera.  Why do I bring up the current first lady in my comment?  Well, I'd like to ask Epstein the same question - why are you aiming this article at Dr. Jill Biden?  There's plenty of non medical Doctors out there to make your case for a cultural war.  But why did you decide to focus attention on Dr. Jill Biden?  You're attacking the future first lady, in an attempt to discredit her?  Why is this important? Why are you trying to discredit and disrespect the wife of the future president?  Have you done any research on her career?  Do you report on educational leadership? Is this a critique on education? It's very strange to observe these modern conservative pundits that completely contradict the 20th century Republican Party values.  Dr. Jill Biden would be the sweetheart of a 1970's conservative....(ps - whenever people hear your name, they think of a child preditor :-)"
James Schumaker,"I heard about this article from all the bashing this poor guy ""Not A Doctor"" Epstein was getting on Twitter and elsewhere and decided to click on over and see what all the fuss was about. Of course, anyone is entitled to their opinion, no matter how arrogant or misconceived, but I honestly thought the WSJ had higher editorial standards.I mean, really, is Epstein related to Rupert Murdoch or someone on the editorial board?  Nepotism is the only way such a piece could ever have been published."
Erich Greenebaum,"Narrator: ""But the Wall Street Journal turned out to just be garbage tabloid journalism."""
Jennifer Crispin,"Instead of spending the last 30 years resenting people with more education than you, you could have tried earning a doctorate. Were you afraid that you might fail? Or were you not accepted at any graduate school? Also, just so you are aware, there is a difference between an honorary doctorate and an earned doctorate. I'll give you a hint, it's hidden in the word ""earned."""
Bill Lee,"Only a dick would write something like this. I'll let others point out how vapid the content is and out-of-touch its sensibility. But your dissing of Dr. Biden's dissertation topic: ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs"" is truly oblivious. In our age of obscene income disparity and university monopolies, community colleges are emerging as a cutting edge for getting underserved people into good jobs. Dear WSJ Editors: you really need to pick up your game."
Jennifer Crispin,Perhaps the issue is that he doesn't think underserved people deserve quality education. That probably makes him feel threatened as well.
John Rudolph,"Whoopi Goldberg close friend of the Bidens with the wisdom of her years hosting ""The View"" announced this summer that Dr. Jill Biden would be a good pick for Surgeon General,  quote Whoopi, ""Because she's a great doctor. ""Crickets. "
David F,"Well, she is a comedian you know."
Emily Hsu,"What fresh misogyny is this? Do you call men, ""kiddo"", too? Are you on a first name basis with every dean and university president? Or do you address them by Ms./Mrs./Mr.?  "
John Bezirganian,"You call them ""Dean Smith"" or ""President Jones""."
Lydia Stewart,"Wow, a white man born in 1937 who has an honorary doctorate degree for his career as ""an essayist"" has misogynistic opinions about something? Oh nooo, *clutches my PhD in ladylike fright* let me weep into my stable career and academic success. Epstein family, someone come get your grandpa. He's done."
Ken Miller,"Are you serious?  The PhD has been diminished?  I had to master two languages, an arduous qualifying exam, had to produce scientific research published in a major journal, and then endure a final oral exam by senior professors.  While I don't use the title except where appropriate, I find it quite revealing that the author of this piece is asking a woman, who clearly earned a doctorate, to refrain from using the title.  Would he advise a man to do the same?C'mon.  There's nothing remotely phony about Jill Biden's doctorate, and therefore the discussion of honorary doctorates (in this opinion piece) is completely beside the point.  What's really going on here is a petty attempt to take an accomplished woman and take her down a notch or two.... and to slime the Biden name as well.  A very transparent effort with clear political motivations.  Simple rule - if you can earn a doctorate, you get to use the title.  What's wrong with that?"
Richard Wilson,Here's a thought : why on earth am I paying money to read this neanderthal piece? Sorry but this is just not worth almost $500/yr.  Hopefully the message will get through that publishing opinion pieces like this is bad for the bottom line even if you can't see why it's bad for our societal discourse or just blatantly misogynistic . 
Bruce M. Herman,Time to cancel my WSJ subscription.
Dan Stifter,I am seriously considering it.  This opinion piece was right out of the 1950's.
Randi Epstein,"Maybe if enough of us cancel today , the data analysts can tie it to this one piece . I'm canceling . I've got better things to read "
Lisa Matovich Brooke,I agree this is what I thought when I read this article.  Also they have nothing about the Texas case for Trump that the Supreme Court refused to hear.
Allen Speight,"They did, but they stuck it on page A3 in today's NE print edition.  "
Gordon Hardy,"""If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try 'rarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.'""Joseph, how many centuries of university life have African American women been denied any such recognition? "
Garrett Mitchell,"Dear Mr. Epstein - It is said that with age comes wisdom, but in your case age showed up all alone.  Dr. Jill Biden is a class act, which may explain why you're having trouble handling your assignment with aplomb. Take two Senokot and follow with some prune juice. That might put a smile on your face and a skip in your step. "
Anne Barnstead-Klos,""" It is said that with age comes wisdom, but in your case age showed up all alone.""That is the best thing I've read in a month!"
Diana Ross,"A wonderful turn of phrase and interesting, even Shakespearian, what is happening to a bunch of older men these days. I'm old enough to remember when Guiliani was considered a decent leader in New York.  Would his younger self recognize his older death-in-venice one?  His shrunk definitely shrank.  Newt Gingrich signing on to the nonsense conspiracy stuff.  Really? Trump even.  He changed - and not for the better.  There seems to be a hardening of the arteries of the soul at a time that some men are still fine vintages.  I mix my metaphors, but you get my point."
Andrew Semple,"More appalling content from the ""opinion"" team."
Dana Eyre,"Ted Koppel gave a graduation address at Stanford. He told a story on a speaker  had refused an invitation  because Stanford doesn't grant  honorary doctorates. Koppel's apocryphal story noted that once  a Cal speaker asked for an honorary degree for his horse.  The Chancellor granted it, noting that it was the first time such a degree had been granted to an entire horse.I don't know Mr. Epstein or the school that gave him his honorary doctorate.  I will note that, as an essayist, he's done a fine job doing what Montaigne set out to do in his original collection - to explore, to attempt or to test - to bring skepticism to bear.  Essais et erreurs - trials and errors.    But bringing skepticism to bear doesn't necessarily bring clarity to the nominal topic.  Sometimes what is revealed is the author, as Montaigne knew.  He wrote """"authors communicate themselves to the people by some especial and extrinsic mark"".  We know more about Mr. Epstein now than we did before. "
Brian Stone,"When the kindergarten principle is ""Dr."" so and so, and when teachers move to get advanced degrees in the final few years of their teaching careers it verifies the scam that is advanced degrees in education.   We have friends getting those higher degrees in  their 50's to take advantage of the pay boost which will reflect in their pensions for the next 30+ years.  So if there is any benefit to the students they will see it for 1-2 years.  The teacher will get the pension boost for the remainder of their lives.   This is the classic case of abuse of a public sector job.  "
Bill Lee,"Brian StoneYour post is a ""classic case"" of stereotyping. "
Mahri Leonard-Fleckman,"What is remarkable to me is not that men like this still exist (as a woman with a PhD, I'm well aware they do), but that the Wall Street Journal would print this ""opinion"" piece. Really, kiddo? Would you condescend to a man this way?"
Tim Finnegan,"This article deserved no space in the WSJ. It wasn't substantive. It didn't address an issue of any importance. It wasn't funny.  You have a problem with how universities grant degrees, go ahead and take that on with a reasoned argument. This wasn't even a good undergraduate level essay."
Matthew Mahoney,"But it plays great with Trump's base who hate both liberals and women (especially educated women), so expect to see plenty more like this. "
Zeb Long,"Well, she may not get to enjoy it long before the Dems find reason to get rid of Bejing Joe either because he is found to be mentally incompetent or ethically compromised via Hunter Biden's "" business"" deals."
BOB SCHAFER,That wasn't a breath of fresh air. It was a soul-cleaning hurricane. THANK YOU!
Gary Jarmin,"Too bad she isn't a real doctor/neurologist who specializes in short-term memory loss, losing one's train of thought or the thread of conversations, mood swings and an increase in impulsivity, irritability or poor judgment-in other words, textbook symptoms of cognitive decline and dementia as demonstrably exhibited by Sleepy. "
Bruce Witkov,Mr. Epstein -- a great piece (despite the whining of readers below).  The whole disintegration of the US education system (from political correctness to the constant dumbing down of courses and grading standards) requires more pieces like yours in mainstream journals.  Thank you for your insights.
Christine Parker,"At least one other person has made this point, but I hold a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University Law Center.  There are MDs and JDs - both are technically doctorate degrees, but I am not permitted to call myself ""Doctor Parker."" Apparently there was a time when calling oneself ""Doctor"" could communicate something meaningful about your educational attainment. I have to agree with the author at least as far as that making something easy to get diminishes its value. Now that a Bachelor's degree is the new high school diploma, you need at least Master's to be taken seriously.  But there are so many cushy Master's programs that that no longer means much. If she has an Ed.D., that's a Doctor of Education, not a Ph.D., and why she can call herself Doctor and I cannot is odd. I don't care to be called Doctor - doesn't matter to me at all. Now that you can basically buy a Ph.D., it shouldn't much matter to anyone else, either.  Seriously, I got two words for you:  Dr. Phil."
Lauren Stiles,An SJD (Doctor of Juridical Science) is the equivalent of a PhD in law. A JD is not. Surely you learned this at some point in your law school education?
Christine Parker,"Well that was snarky. I compared the MD and the JD. I mean, it's in the title: juris DOCTOR. You can also get a Ph.D. in medicine, but that doesn't keep us from calling MDs ""Doctor."" I'm afraid that the law school curriculum involved no courses dedicated to other types of law degrees. We only studied the law.I don't think my educational attainment should blow anyone's mind. However, I do think there is a difference in the rigor of a JD program at a top law school and a Doctor of Education at the University of Delaware. There isn't anything wrong with getting the latter, but not the same.When it is easy to get an advanced degree, it dilutes the importance of the degree overall. My favorite example of this is how taboo follows rhetoric: the term ""secretary"" is now offensive, so we have administrative assistants, but everyone knows it's a fancy way to say secretary. So now we have executive assistants who do not support executives.  Stewardesses became flight attendants. "
Joe Piombino,"Those in the education establishment outside of the medical and scientific professions who insist on being addressed as ""Doctor"" are pompous buffoons.  I am sure Mrs. Biden will get fawning press from the in-the-bag MSM. Bravo, Mr. Epstein.  You cut to the heart of the matter, as always.  Keep calling it like it is."
SAMUEL GREENGARD,"The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of itself. This is a minsogynst and intellectually corrupt piece that denigrates real work accomplishments. I realize it's fashionable to bash learning and intellectualism at this point in history but this piece is vile and very ugly. And, by the way, writing an editorial for the WSJ use to means something. It may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards in editorial judgment an expertise."
BOB SCHAFER,Please identify the real work.
Robin Lake,"This is truly pathetic, WSJ. I, too, work at a university in a high level position with no PhD. I have disdain for much of academic goofiness. I am a woman who is not easily offended. But really. To use such belittling language as ""kiddo"" is a coward's attack mode.  To mock a dissertation on community college retention/attrition is ignorant of the importance of the issue to our economy. I expect more from these opinion pages. This is beneath you. "
BOB SCHAFER,Care to share the importance of the issue? Millions of people make career decisions every day. What's golden about a community college?
Karen Riley,"Care to comment on the belittling use of the word kiddo? Or is that just par for the course in your misogynistic world view? Community colleges offer an affordable way for low-income and underserved students to earn a BA by transferring to a four-year school. Unfortunately,  a small percentage of those intending to transfer don't succeed in doing that over six years. I'm assuming that's an issue Dr. Biden addressed in her dissertation."
BOB SCHAFER,"So, you reaffirm the fact millions of people make career decisions every day. The arrogance of your disapproval of them not toeing your line is disgusting and elitist. In my experience ""kiddo"" is an endearing term used to address both sexes. Your belittling understanding reflects an odd sensitivity."
John Hanley,"Do you think the term ""kiddo"" was used endearingly in this context?"
Bob Hampel,"Jill took two of my seminars at the University of Delaware.  She was amazing.  I saw how hard she worked.   And with her classmates she never displayed the pompous arrogance of Mr. Epstein, who might be a bit more humble if he had endured the rigors of a good doctoral program.  "
Charles Dahan,What is this garbage? We all pay quite a bit to read the incredible reporting by the Journal's world class reporters. The intellectual lightweights and their inane ramblings in the opinion section undermine their work. 
Mark Graban,"Editorials like this are why I called the other day to cancel my WSJ subscription. I'll miss the reporting, Dan Neil, Jason Gay, Lettie Teague... but I cannot keep paying this company each month.  The WSJ, like the Republican Party, has lost its mind."
G Shiner,"I love these editorials.  Essentially no other newspaper besides maybe the NY Post offers needed criticism of Democratic policies and personalities.  The collusion of the media in covering up the Hunter Biden story with its tax fraud, foreign money, diamond smuggling and Chinese connections should make you want to take the red pill instead of cancelling the WSJ.  "
John Hanley,"Taking on the left's overrepresentation in mass media is not a cause that should be conflated with the kind of commentary in this opinion piece.  With all due respect to the author, the overall tone and message comes across like something an internet troll would write. I think it runs contradictory to the Journal's standards of good taste, and this topic deserves a better take."
G Shiner,"Mmm.... No.  I think that one part of the job of newspapers and the press is to deflate the self-aggrandizement of our leaders.  IMHO, few balloons need more popping than people in positions of power holding on to titles undeserved as so much as English nobility.  Laura Schlessinger, ""Dr. Laura"", the radio show host would also do this.  While her PhD  was in physiology (like learning how the heart or lungs work), she had no business pretending to be psychiatrist or psychotherapist by throwing around her title.  She needed to be taken down a peg too.  "
Tami Oliver,I recently subscribed to the WSJ because I was tired of hitting their paywall reading news articles. This piece has shown me the error of my ways and I have canceled. There is no need to pay for this misogynistic garbage; there are plenty of other old white men doling it out for free.
Charles Dahan,"I'll continue to subscribe (and purchase a substantial number of subscriptions for coworkers, because the Journal's reporters produce indispensable information). But an octogenarian who lucked into a teaching job at Northwestern with only a BA speaking down to a professor because he does not respect her ""Ed.D from the University of Delaware"" is gross.Do better, for the sake of your readers and your world class reporters."
Jennifer Crispin,"I just subscribed, but WSJ is on notice. More of this misogynistic garbage and I'll take my dollars elsewhere."
David Haskell,"Wow, WSJ, you actually printed this patronizing, condescending sneer? It would be harder to scrape deeper in the barrel. On the up-side, it has been years since  I read a piece less self-aware and more tone-deaf, so thanks for the milestone. "
E Hines,"To quote another wise man, what a maroon.The lady has a Doctorate in Education, earned as even the maroon acknowledges, even as he disdains the title of her dissertation, apparently because it isn't buried in obfuscating academese. I wonder if Epstein--you Kid--has read it.Regardless of what one might think of Jill Biden, she holds a doctorate, and it is entirely correct, and entirely appropriate, to address her as Doctor.One more thing: according to the logic of his wise man, a heart surgeon cannot call himself ""Doctor."" Neither can a particular renowned neurosurgeon. At least Bugs' remark is entirely consistent.It does say volumes about the maroon, though, that this is the thing he found about which to whine.Eric Hines"
Sonia Fahey,What's the difference?  Clearly just a personal shot...was there a shortage of substantive pieces to fill the page.
George Reid,"This piece was a cheap shot. Teachers and our public education system provide the foundation for our country's economy as well as scientific/technological superiority.  Education leaders and EdDs/PhDs provide the training and infrastructure for our teachers.  As a former high school science teacher and  PhD in education, I remember several MDs who thanked me for getting them interested in science."
Devin Bready,"This is, objectively, not a substantive discussion which has any bearing on the direction of the incoming administration. It's closer to the words of a school yard bully. The editorial board needs to exercise more discretion.  "
Elizabeth Lippoff,"I disagree with much of what he says. First, his tone is so sarcastic, supercilious and smarmy. ""Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware...."" I have to don my writer's hat (a little experience here and there and a MAT, although I doubt he'd give credence to either) and ask, ""Well, did you research this or didn't you? Is it or isn't it?"" Second, he seems to be saying that doctorates in anything but medicine are meaningless today because (1) people no longer have to work very hard to get them and (2) universities give out tons of honorary doctorates to people who aren't smart enough to deserve them. 
I did note that he taught at the university level for years, with a BA. I imagine he and his therapist (Dr. Somebody?) have plenty of issues to explore."
Mark Graban,"He actually called her ""kiddo."" That's so diminishing and offensive..."
randy gibbs,"Ludicrous article! Who cares what she calls herself! An educated woman in the White House is better than a former porn star! ""Be Best"" and find something more important to complain about!"
Royce Northcutt,"Seriously, WSJ? ""Kiddo?"" This is disgusting misogyny. You owe Dr Biden (NOT ""Dr Jill) an apology "
Bob Schofner,"This opinion piece is so cynical, politically incorrect and filled with so many unspoken truths that it made me smile and laugh.  Thanks for allowing this missive which will no doubt be considered offensive by so many people to be published.  I found it refreshing."
Richard Murphy,Here's the real question:  Does Joe think she has an MD?  I bet he does and he thinks that's how the Biden family attained its great wealth.
PAUL JOHNSTON,"Referring to the First Lady of the United States as ""kiddo"" could be a a new low for a WSJ  Editorial. A hard feat considering the revisionist, misogynist dribble that so often ends up on these pages. "
Lawrence Smith,"I have a JD - people have called me lots of names but never doctor. Used to have a large state university client which had signs in each conference room stating: 'check your titles at the door'. Finally, I have never ever met anyone with a non-medical doctorate who inisisted on being addressed as 'doctor'. In non-academic circles they would probably be dismissed as an obnoxious fool."
Kurt Reiser,"Might holding oneself out as a ""doctor"" based on a J.D. alone be misleading and thus a violation of the rules of professional ethics?"
Bob Schofner,"This opinion piece is so cynical, politically incorrect and filled with so many unspoken truths that it made me smile and laugh.  Thanks for allowing this missive which will no doubted be considered offensive by so many people to be published.  I found it refreshing."
tim williams,"I get annoyed when people at work insist on being called doctor... but I work in a hospital.  At least these people have MD's.  A friend of a friend is a chiropractor for horses... he insists on being called doctor too, but at least it's only in his professional capacity.  Aaaand then there's Jill who wants to be called 'doctor' outside of her professional capacity because she has a degree in education.... people there's no reason to be offended!  The joke is on her."
Kathy Barkulis,Lots of PhD's commenting below their disgust at being called pretentious because of this article.  That just proves how pretentious they really are. And complaining that Epstein dare write the article in the first place. Good to know PhD's have less than open minds for a different opinion. Just cancel anyone who holds a different opinion?  Stop publishing opinions that don't align with your own self-important ideology?  Please. 
Melanie Johnson,"It's interesting that you've leveled the use of Dr. Biden's earned title as 'fraudulent, even comic' when you yourself have managed a 30-year career at a prestigious university without even an MA, let alone a doctorate, in a field where many who have actually completed their doctoral studies in English and Writing find themselves forced to rely on food stamps in order to survive their appalling wages and conditions as adjuncts. And yet  you currently enjoy the title of 'Emeritus Professor.'  In other words, professor who retains a title  as an honorific, without actually doing the work. "
Donna Maria Ticchi,"The  title ""Professor Emeritus"" is granted to those who retire from faculty appointments at an institution of higher learning.   As such, it is an ""earned"" title, and Joseph Epstein - with 30 years of faculty service at Northwestern University - has earned his title.  It is not unusual for writers - without advanced degrees - to hold university appointments based on their writing - some as artists-in-residence or visiting professors and others as faculty members.    Junot Diaz teaches creative writing at MIT, for example."
G Shiner,"Being given honorific titles and insisting on other people using them are two different things.  If the author ran around demanding people address him as ""professor"" he'd be as ridiculous as Jill Biden running around demanding people call her ""Dr."" for her lame degree.  "
Diana Ossana,"How in the world did WSJ authorize this medieval ""journalism"", this condescending snobbery? This seems fit for National Enquirer. A grown man ""explaining"" to an accomplished, dignified woman how she should refer to herself? PLEASE! Another reason why the majority of my personal friends have been and always will be women. And why I find my female characters far more complex than my male characters. This is all the response that this laughable opinion piece deserves."
Richard Benedict,"Why does Joseph Epstein misstate his own academic degree when he is so critical of Jill Biden for using the Dr. honorific?  He tells us that he graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A., but Chicago grants an A.B. (Artium Baccalaureus).  Likely answer is that in his professional circle, it is more common to refer to a bachelor's degree as a BA.  Likewise in Jill Biden's professional circles, the practice is to use the honorific.  "
Willie Sullivan,"The part of this article that I found MOST offensive was the condescension towards Dr. Biden's dissertation topic. I'm confused. Is it wrong to want to see community college students succeed? This guy is a clown and an elitist. He says ""University of Delaware"" like going to that school alone should disqualify anyone from being able to be deemed intelligent. "
Deborah Harada,"This piece is not up to the quality I expect from WSJ. There are so many issues with Mr. Epstein's comments, but others have already pointed those out. I'll add to the fray, by asking Mr. Epstein about his knowledge base on Dr. Biden's ""unpromising"" thesis. A college education is a way out of poverty for many people and families. Student retention is a complicated issue, especially at the community college level. Why are you picking at Dr. Biden for using an honorific she's earned instead of applauding her commitment to her students and accessible education?  And to the editors, at a time when there are so many pressing issues, this is where you focus your attention? I know you can do better. "
lina reid,Cause...no one uses Dr. for an Ed.d. Its silly.
G Shiner,Because its a huge character flaw.  
t chapman,As an inquisitive doctor she must be perplexed by how her hubby amassed such a family fortune from a career spent solely in public service.  Perhaps Mr. Barr will provide her some insights...
Kathy Barkulis,"Great article.  The wife of a serial plagiarist has to bestow some kind of pretentious title on herself in order to bring ""honor"" to her corrupt family.  Pitiful, isn't it?"
Anne Conroy,Is she suppose to drop any reference to her credentials? 
Kathy Barkulis,Credentials are in the eye of the beholder. 
Anne Conroy,"Does she have an EdD?  Yes.  Does that degree come with an honorific of ""doctor""?  Yes.I understand criticism of using that honorific for people who earned EdD, or even PhDs, but to level this criticism at one person who is one of however many people who use the ""doctor"" honorific is lame."
Marina de Gramont,"The condescending misogyny of this article is infuriating. Because people wrongfully called Mr. Epstein Dr., they should stop rightfully using the term for Dr. Biden? And why sneer at her dissertation topic, which is vitally important? I'm glad we've reached a cultural moment when this kind of arrogance only invites derision toward the author of this piece  -- not the  person  he's targeting, who's clearly his better in every way."
Teresa mitchell,"Epstein wrote ""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child.""Well, I guess since DR. BIDEN has, in fact, delivered a child, Epstein should have no problem with her using the honorific."
Shoshannah Cohen,Hehehehe.  I hadn't thought of that!  Good point.  :)
Dan R,"In fact, Jill Biden does not have a PhD.  She has an Educational Doctorate degree.  There is a big difference.  A PhD degree goes back to the 12th century. in Europe, and has a long history of being the highest degree across most fields of study.  It is a mark of serious scholarship now and always has been.  On the other hand, the Ed.D. is only given in Education departments and only starting in the last century.   "
Gayle Deneen,"Such poor taste.  Fox News, WSJ....everyday they find a new low."
Barry Rabin,"Unbelievably insensitive. Please see my response column, sent to WSJ Op-Ed submissions, about my own mother's arduous quest for her own doctorate in her 50s. "
Rebekah Kuschmider,"""A wise man once said that no one should call himself ""Dr."" unless he has delivered a child. Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.""
Dr. Biden DID deliver a child. Ashley, her daughter. Also, educators deliver wisdom to students. Methinks this author has an inferiority complex about his own relative lack of education. 

He should find a Doctor of Psychology to address that with him. "
Dakota Erikson,"Epstein seems to think that an EdD is an honorary degree.  It is not and was first awarded at Harvard in 1921.
Dr. Canipe at Walden Univ. said, ""I believe the EdD program is more difficult (than the PhD program).  Both programs require researching and gathering data; however, there is an added layer with the EdD degree and that is coming up with a solution to address that problem.  It's a very practical activity."" Additionally, Biden has two master's degrees from West Chester University and Villanova University. Now I would like Epstein to discuss whether Putin was better looking 20 yrs ago when he wore mascara or if DeVos knew which end of a pencil held the eraser.A note to WSJ:  What a vapid article.  The editors should know better.
"
ASHISH ARORA,Said better than I could have.  
Gerry Lopez,Dr J's title is more earned.  
J C,I am a research scientist in the biotech field and have a Ph.D. in biology.In professional circles sometimes I am called Dr but most of the time we are on a first name basis and that's fine. Frankly I don't get it why she insist in being called Dr.  
Andi Judt,"Have you thought about supplementing calcium and vitamin D? I know it helps strengthen bones, but maybe it could help with your fragile ego. I haven't seen such drivel since Michael Levin tried to take on the phrase ""okay, boomer,"" in January."
Kevin Koharki,"The only people who claim a PhD degree is not rigorous have never gone through the process.  However, I do agree that only M.D.s have earned the title of ""Dr."".  Don't take my word for it, ask just about any ""old school"" M.D., they'll tell you the same.  This is precisely the reason I tell my students to call me ""Professor"".  "
Scott Manson CPA JD,I had one accounting professor years ago who would not answer to Professor but only Doctor
Cynthia Bond,Perhaps you could litigate against his misrepresentation.
Rank Thomas,I still subscribe to the piled higher and deeper theory.
Paul Callaro,"Mr. Epstein, your first sentence says Dr. Biden should drop her honorific for a ""not unimportant reason"" yet you never tell us what that serious reason is.  Instead, we get your passive aggressive humblebragging about your own education.  More humorous is your case for the diminution of the ""honorary"" doctorate which you hold.  Dr. Biden did the work for a real doctorate.Let it go Mr. Epstein.  Dr. Biden earned her Ph.d; her chosen field of study is irrelevant.  If you not so secretly yearn for such an honorific, go back to school and do the work.  "
Jennifer Crispin,There is no evidence in this essay that Mr. Epstein is aware of the difference between an honorary doctorate and an earned doctorate.
Paul Callaro,That seems to depend on the field of study.  He has animus toward the field of education.  
Thomas Villa,"Mr. Epstein - A ""BA in absentia,"" honorary doctorates, Henry James house calls? You've outdone yourself. Perhaps in a future piece you might address the recent trend of listing all one's degrees rather than the highest degree earned, as was the custom of old. Thank you for writing with wit and style. "
John Pappas,"Terrific article snd spot on...For those of us who earned an M.D. (Medical Doctor) degree, we refer to ourselves as ""physicians"" to distinguish from the faux""Dr.""  Phd. crowd."
James Howard,"As ""doctor"" is the Latin word for teacher, I cannot but wonder why the faux-doctor MD crowd uses it.  Must be trying to gain prestige.  "
Matthew Goodman,"Hey buddy, can you tell me what PhD stands for? PhDs didn't make up the name, they just earned it. Doctor is literally in the name. It's not their fault people with fragile egos like yourself can't handle someone else calling themselves a doctor. Go find something else, something actually important, to get angry about. Maybe then you can make a difference. "
Dana Eyre,"Glad you're happy as a ""faux Dr."" being called a physician.  Perhaps if you'd paid a bit more attention in undergraduate English or history you'd know that the Latin root noun doctor originates from docere, to show, teach, or cause to know.  In the early Middle Ages, it referred to church fathers and theologians - in that sense, the late Dr. Martin Luther King, or Dr Raphael Warnock (PhD Union Theological Seminary Columbia University)  have more of a historical claim to be called Dr. than you do.   Physicians, seeking to differentiate themselves from quacks and barbers in the late Middle Ages, started calling themselves Doctors of ""Phesike"" - as recorded in Chaucer.    Those of us focused on the production and dissemination of knowledge using the rigorous techniques of our disciplines are happy to lend you the title, Dr..  You are skilled in your profession and discipline, as I am in mine.   "
Rank Thomas,"Entertainers, who didn't bother feigning intelligence, were next. Gotta love it except now a days they feign it."
Marion Anderson,Thank you for addressing this matter of self-importance.  It is important to be modest about our achievements and demonstrate through our actions our abilities and value.  
Richard Porter,"Epstein is an infamous intolerant self important snob, and part of the new Bedford Forrest movement. Dr Biden should laugh him off."
LILLIAN FILEGAR,"I've been telling everyone that I must now be addressed as ""Dr. Lil"".  Surely a J.D. trumps an Ed.D.!!"
John Stevenson,"As a journalist, I offer this from the Associated Press Stylebook:Use Dr. in first reference as a formal title before the name of an individual who holds a doctor of dental surgery, doctor of medicine, doctor of optometry, doctor of osteopathic medicine, doctor of podiatric medicine, or doctor of veterinary medicine: Dr. Jonas Salk. ... Do not use Dr. before the names of individuals who hold other types of doctoral degrees.This has been the AP standard for all my years in journalism, but I had to check after reading this article because it seems to me that, in deference to Dr. Jill, a lot of AP members are ignoring this sound rule that they've abided by for decades.It's actually embarrassing to me."
Cynthia Bond,It should be especially embarrassing to another individual . . . .
Sabareesh Indrasenan,"Not worthy of WSJ, the recent decline of editorial standards have been painful and is reeking of desperation. "
Jane R Dunlevy,"If WSJ wants to keep my subscription, then 'opinions' and/or articles that are antiquated, misogynistic, and insulting to anyone who has a sliver of respect for science, reason, and logic will stop being 'published'. Now."
Jeff Michalski,"Dr. Biden earned her degree and along with it the privilege of being called ""Doctor"". Her degree and title is no less worthy than other doctorates including PhD, DDS, DSc, DC, etc. Chiropractors, optometrists, psychologists, osteopaths, allopaths, all deserve the respect earned by their degree. It's so sad to see someone of poor character and weak mind so offended by the title that he felt the need to draft a screed of self-pity."
Michael Kossart,I am ashamed of WSJ for allowing this garbage into its esteemed paper. I get people are political hacks but really when your biggest complaint about a partisan is if they can use the Dr. Label its gone too far and WSJ should have some level of control of what it allows on and in its pages?
Dan Mac Kinney,"I have an Ed.D but generally decline to use the honorific Dr. fearing that some might start talking to me about medicine and then realize that I am not a ""real"" doctor.  I only use the title Dr. when writing to my senator or congressman hoping that it might make my opinion look weightier. "
Robert Cameron,"Dear Mr.  Epstein,Can you please point me to the article you wrote about Dr. Sebastian Gorka's abuse of honorifics?I'll wait.Robert Cameron"
Sebastian Elischer,"I am surprised to find such a poor opinion piece in the WSJ. Please note: It is Kaffeeklatsch, never kaffeeklatsch. In the bad old days, they would have known. "
Bud Robinson,Good to see the WSJ editorial side has its finger on the pulse of the nation with this.....I'm sure educated suburban women will love to see it...
Mike Rose,"Being totally disinterested in the comically inept Joe Biden as I have been, I never did bestir myself to learn anything about his wife. I have heard her referred to as Dr. Jill Biden innumerable times, and as the sycophantic leftist press no doubt desired, I assumed she was a medical doctor. But WHY am I at all surprised to find out that she only holds a ""doctorate"" in a meaningless discipline for an even less meaningful body of personal work?"
Matthew Goodman,"1. Why did you assume it was medical doctor initially? No one said she was. You know what happens when you assume things.  I get you're probably not around a lot of academics, but at a university for example, every single professor I've encountered with a doctorate (in any field) refers to themselves and has their students and colleagues refer to them as ""Dr. so-and-so""2. Education is ""meaningless?"" Again, it's clear you don't associate yourself with educated people, but anyone with half a brain could tell you how important and impactful proper education is to our youth and our society. 3. Clearly your opinions stem from hatred and resentment towards the ""sycophantic left."" Who brought political affiliation into this? Oh that was you. Maybe if you put the same energy into improving our country that you do into being a keyboard warrior against the ""radical left,"" we might see some changes. Sadly, there's no hope that someone like you could accomplish anything of that nature. "
Mike Rose,"During the campaign I heard NUMEROUS comments from DOCTOR JILL BIDEN about bumbling Joe's health trumpeted about by the leftist media. And there is NO doubt whatsoever that they intended for anyone who heard it to make the assumption that she was a medical doctor. Education is very important. And because it is, our system of higher INDOCTRINATION is an enemy of education. And I do what I can to improve our nation. Such as pointing out the rampant sycophancy of the leftist press which is a tool and servant of the socialist Democrat party that is destroying this nation. Sadly there's no hope that someone so blind as you would ever open their eyes to reality."
Mac Moore,"Goodman writes, ""1. Why did you assume it was medical doctor initially? Simply because society holds a medical doctor's title in special regard to be recognized in case of an emergency.  When a health emergency arises, ""is there a doctor in the house?"" is not a cry for inventory or to seek out academics.  Big difference, if you care."
Steven Scott,"Said the noted homophobe, adding misogyny to his crotchety character faults."
Mac Moore,"I don't think ""homophobe"" or ""misogyny"" means what you think it means."
Don Brazier,It would appear that a doctorate in medicine is more important than a doctorate in education.As far back as I can remember people with doctorates in non-medical fields were addressed as Doctor. Now that the first lady of the United States is going to have a doctorate somebody has decided to make a political issue out it.I am quite willing to let Dr Biden determine whether or not she wishes to retain the title.
Mary Wooten,"Without educators, there would be no qualified medical doctors. "
James Howard,Doctors were teachers millenia before they were healers.
Mario Herger,"That opinion piece says more about the character of a Joseph Epstein, then it says about the first lady. Here somebody with a PhD, there somebody with PhD envy, who's also a misogynist and a newspaper that deems it appropriate to publish yet another piece of trying to put women in their place.Shame on you, Joseph Epstein!"
Ralph Jedda,Anyone who asks what Jill Biden's specialty is can be told she is a doctor of community college education.  Oh!!
Bud Robinson,There were 5.6m community college students at the end of 2018. Understanding  the best ways for them to succeed seems like a fairly important thing to study. 
Lidiana Rodriguez,Nice condescension. Effective in keeping a classist system going.
Mary Wooten,"The current first lady has no post-high school education at all. In fact, she was posing nude at a point in her life when she should have been attending college.   But heaven forbid the next first lady acknowledge her PhD in her title. "
Joseph Steiniger,These comments read like my Twitter feed.  So we're all in agreement. Shameful.  
Marc Steinberg,"Mr. Epstein, From the title, I thought this was just the honest ignorance of someone who didn't bother to do the research and learn that the title ""doctor"" was used for those with Ph.D.s well before physicians started using the term. Then I read the first paragraph and see that misogyny is your real intent here. Sincerely, Marc Steinberg, Ph.D. (but you call call me Marc, or, apparently 'kiddo' if ""Dr."" upsets you so greatly, Mr. Epstein.)"
MEAGHAN BYRNE,"Why on earth would the WSJ assume this is worth publishing? It's sexist, PhD envy. I downgraded my account to desktop digital only after you published that horrible op-ed from Senator Johnson (and published my own reply in the Georgetown Security Studies Review). I am now certain I can find my market data via a subscription to Bloomberg."
GARY WITT,"Ugh, don't get me started.  Years ago a law degree was an LL.M.  Then some brainiac decided to inflate it into a ""Juris Doctor.""  The curriculum didn't change but the title did.  Frankly I'd rather be an honest master of laws than a pretentious doctor."
Nancy Daby,"Regarding Mr. Epstein's exercise in self pity:""Bitter, party of one..."""
Tracy Harris,"For some reason economists and physicists never call themselves ""Dr."" while educators with a D. Ed. always do.(Douglas Levene)"
Robert Holeman,"Currently in a mid-level 4- year college.  Came from  night-school & distance learning programs.  All of my current professors are sure to tell me if they have a Ph.D.  Previous instructors, not so much tough some did reach that level.  Yet, I've never been as disappointed in the quality of materials & instruction than I am right now.  I guess its a bit of proof, Those that can, do.  Those that can't, teach."
Pia Sen,"As a PhD and a professor in economics, let me tell you that is unadulterated rubbish. *White male* PhDs occasionally - just occasionally - go the ""oh just call me by my first name"" once they know that the genuflections will be coming anyway. But these days the majority of economics PhDs are women and people of color/immigrants, and yes we DO expect to be called 'Dr.' - much to the chagrin, I am sure,  of the likes of Epstein who would MUCH rather call us 'kiddo'."
James Howard,My doctorate is in public policy.  The only people I tell to call me doctor are those without a doctorate.  It's important to respect your betters.
MICHAEL RUPP,"The word doctor comes from the Latin 'docere' (to teach).  Thus, physicians (the proper term) appropriated this honorific designation from scholars.  Someone with an advanced degree would have known that.  Mr. Esptein appears to be suffering from what we in academia refer to as ""PhD envy."""
John Petro,Did you read the article? Epstein appears to be very comfortable not having a PhD.
Lidiana Rodriguez,You bought that?
Andi Judt,"He's so comfortable he spent half of it downplaying the accomplishment of getting one and the other half, bizarrely enough, telling us how honorary doctorates don't mean anything. Yes, he's very comfortable."
John Petro,I find him to be 'honest' and not shy about speaking truth to power and not afraid to tell various emperors that they have little or no clothes. And I'd also throw in a dash of humility given his self-depreciation. It'd be nice to see some humility regarding how she's addressed in Dr. Jill.
Marc Steinberg,"""PhD envy!"" That's great! I'm in academia too, but hadn't heard that before."
Frances Clemmensen,"Kiddo Epstein has too much rancor in his heart.  What a waste of time to read this trashy, judgmental opinion.....one he should have kept to himself.   Dr. Biden earned the title and respect.  She is much admired.   "
L M,Strange and unnecessary. 
Paula Jansen,This is not worthy of WSJ.  
Sandy Bolek,"""Kiddo""?  It's impossible to take an essay seriously that begins on such a condescending note. "
Mac Moore,"Biden sometimes references Jill as ""kiddo"", and, I agree, Joe is being condescending when he uses it.  But, then, Joe is famous for such condescending comments."
Robert Cameron,Mac Moore? Frankly I'd prefer Less.
PETER J DANKO,I don't think a husband's use of the term toward his wife is the same as a writer's use of it in a national publication.
Mac Moore,"DANKO writes, ""I don't think a husband's use of the term toward his wife is the same as a writer's use of it in a national publication.""The writer only includes it as one of the monikers that Joe uses when speaking of his wife.  The author did not invent the nickname, Joe did."
Mary Wooten,It's his wife.  His pet names for her are his business. 
Mac Moore,"Wooten writes, ""It's his wife.  His pet names for her are his business.""Agreed.  Yet, Joe makes it public.  Weird, huh?"
Patricia Brasher,"Mr. Epstein, this kiddo who holds a Juris Doctorate, could care less if Jill Biden uses the  title of PhD, a very common practice among educators with doctorate degrees. I much prefer ""Dr."" Jill Biden to  dishonest Melania (no degree) Trump, a/k/a nude model, escort and gold-digger.You sound very much like an old man who has watched the world pass him by and is filled with resentment. Not unlike the guy who just lost the election by 7 million votes. "
John Stewart,"Medical School is nothing more than a high level trade school.   You are just there to absorb what is known in the field.  PhD's are required to expand  whatever field of knowledge they specialize in.   Since a doctor is a ""teacher"" or ""learned person"" it applies to both.  However, when people ask me what I do for a living I tell them I am a physician."
Joseph Poplawski,Graduate students in education have the lowest GRE scores on campus.  Bill Cosby holds a PhD in Education.
James Howard,"Two sentences, both of them are wrong.  The lowest average GRE scores belong to theology and religion departments.  Bill Cosby holds an EdD."
Mac Moore,"Exactly.  Well said.I live nearby many medical doctors.  We only use first names when addressing each other.  If, by chance, I meet them at their work, I will address them as doctors.  But, socially, even they prefer first names.The Biden's fixation with calling Jill by Doctor is bizarre, and, a bit pitiful."
Robert Cameron,"Now that Democrats are back in the White House we can return to ""scandals"" like Obama's tan suit and Dr. Biden's use of an honorific. Meanwhile 3,000 people will die of Covid-19 today, just like yesterday, pushing the USA over the 300K hard. Ask some of the ""many medical doctors you live nearby"" which one of these things is pitiful, and if one of them is a shrink, ask them about  your fixation with  what Jill & Joe Biden call each other."
John Petro,"Now that Democrats are back in the White House we can return to ""scandals"" like Obama's tan suit and Dr. Biden's use of an honorific.That is thanks to a press and media that will see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. Take a look at the quotes of MSM 'journalists' from the weeks before the election when Hunter's computer became public, they fell all over each other in expressions of ""nothing to see here folks"". The democrats can do as they wish for the next 4 years, colluding with whatever foreign gov they wish and the toughest questions we will hear Joe asked is ""what's is like living with a real doctor."""
Mac Moore,"Cameron writes, ""we can return to ""scandals"" like Obama's ...""Attempts to paint police as racists.  Yes, Biden and Obama will continue that agenda to divide America by race and hate.  It is what they do.  And, sadly, they get elected."
James Howard,"Just curious: When have you encountered Dr. Biden in a social capacity, rather than professional?"
Mac Moore,"Howard writes, ""When have you encountered Dr. Biden in a social capacity, rather than professional?""Always.  I have never even seen her in her professional capacity, much less encountered her there."
James Howard,"Oh, like a party or something similar?"
Patricia S Bailon,"Mrs. Biden should enter the White House as First Lady Jill Biden.Ed.D of education;  Dr. Jill Biden, while hers to do with as she pleased, was misleading  during campaign.  Those who listened knew she taught school.  Did her students call her doctor Biden?"
nicholas de luca,"Epstein, what a petty and churlish  essay this is. Demeaning Dr. Biden's EdD is small-minded and  gratutious . And good sir, to what end ?Trumpians have pushed  anti-intellectualism  and denigrated education and science for the last four years. Why ?"
Mac Moore,"luca writes, ""Trumpians have pushed  anti-intellectualism  and denigrated education and science for the last four years""Such as?  What is it with Lefty's and their need to invent facts for lack of any evidence?"
nicholas de luca,"Well  Mac, It is DeLuca not luca. Let's start with the denial of science and expertise by the President and his enablers. First , Covid19 virus was a political hoax. It was then not very serious and would magicaly disappear. Then when the CDC created guidelines to help mitigate the virus POTUS, immediately flaunted them a nd encouraged his cultists to ignore them. When the data showing the serious spread of the virus, he forbade the CDC from reporting them and instead required all data to go through the WH. Finally Trump simply abandoned any interest in the virus  and instead focused on the election he just lost.No one needs to ""invent facts"" about the virus. To wit,  since March 2020 , 16,016,159  confirmed cases of Covid19 have been reported in the USA. Similarly, 298,904 Americans have died of the virus. Yesterday there were 280,514 new cases of the virus were reported.  Yesterday, 108,108 Americans were hospitalized with the virus. BE SURE TO WEAR YOUR MASK !!"
David D'Addona,"If anyone is the ""kiddo"" it is Joseph Epstein.   This piece is ridiculous, petty, childish, and unnecessary.  I guess you just want people to have more outrage and division for no reason in this era of outrage, misinformation, and disinformation.  Thanks soooo much for bringing this opinion to everyone's attention.  Now go away little boy."
William Watson,Me doctor too.  My LLB was upgraded to a JD a few years after I graduated.
Dana Eyre,"The use of the JD for lawyers is another ""appropriation"" of the original use of the term ""Doctor"" for teacher (see my earlier post).  It has to do with the origins of legal training, back in England at the Inns of Court, and in the US as an apprenticeship.  Recall stories of Abraham Lincoln reading law at night.  In the late 19th and early 20th century, those that practiced law sought to professionalize and polish the community, and began awarding JD degrees.   While some JD's go on to teach, more specialized and academic degrees are available  - LLDs and PhDs in Law for those seeking to teach, as opposed to practice.  So, Esquire, if you'd like to call yourself Doctor, that's fine with me, but it's your legal peers to set the norm in the US."
Osgood Carruthers,"This is petty.  But consistent with the level of discourse we usually see from Mr. Epstein.I really don't care if she does or doesn't use Dr., people figure out pretty quickly what's going on.After all, the title Jill Biden uses is the least of Joe Biden's worries, given the widespread fraud and corruption with which he's tainted."
CANDACE SIMPSON,"As an education 'Dr Jill' is a mandated reporter for those abusing kids. Either she hasn't seen the pictures of her 'son' Hunter walking around nude with his junk hanging out while an unnamed young girl sits in the tub behind him or the nicer one leaning up against a doorway with a little boy sitting on the bed. OR 'Dr Jill' will do anything, including abusing her husband while he is clearly sick and demented, putting up with her husband and brother-in-law launder bribe money from the CCP and Ukraine, for money and influence. The very fact that she insists on this pretentious, elitist title is that yes, she is THAT KIND OF PERSON."
Mac Moore,"Carruthers writes, ""This is petty.  But consistent with the level of discourse we usually see from Mr. Epstein.""Oh, my!  Did he insult your sensibilities?  You can call Jill, ""Doctor Jill"" if  it makes you feel better.
"
Pia Sen,He insulted decency and good taste. But I am sure his level of discourse won't insult ball-scratchers such as yourself.Do you also take pride in passing gas at meetings ?
Jonathan Isham,"The Wall Street Journal published this?! Poor Mr. Epstein, truly focussing on the issues that matter."
Sven-Eric Jordt,"Mr. Epstein, don't try to mislead smart people, you will inevitably fail. Doctorates were awarded to scholars centuries before physicians were even considered academics. You know this. Dr. Biden can list this title with pride before her name. From a Ph.D.  .  I am sure you haven't read Dr. Biden's dissertation in preparation for this piece."
Noah Reitman,This is so insulting!  Blame higher Ed if you've got a problem with the honorific.
Mark Hofer,"Stealing the line from economist Russ Roberts: ""I'm a doctor, but not the kind that helps people.""Words change meaning over time, and we shouldn't be too quick to lament that. However, just because there has been change, that doesn't mean it is necessarily good change or bad. And confusion over words does not mean that the word should be therefore abandoned."
Krista Dorgan,"This is such an odd piece. A person who has a doctorate is a doctor.  I have a doctorate and so does my husband. We both work in healthcare and both completed residencies. As mine is a PharmD, I am only addressed as Dr. at professional conferences, while teaching pharmacy students, etc.  But we are both technically Dr. Dorgans. . "
Osgood Carruthers,"I know many legitimate docs that don't even use the title.  At some point if you're sufficiently confident in who you are and what you do, it's superfluous."
nicholas de luca,Be still my heart. 
Stephen Walters,"Well said, Mr. Epstein.One of my (doctorate-holding) professors once remarked ""anyone who is not an M.D. but insists on being called Doctor should never be trusted.""Related,  he also began one lecture by holding up a  sheaf of papers and saying ""if you see me come into the room with notes, it means I don't really know what I'm talking about that day."""
Jessica Murray,"Less than half of Ph.D. students finish their degrees. I just finished my social science doctorate after six years. It was the most difficult thing I have done in my life. After getting accepted, a hurdle in itself, I completed two and a half years of course work, two written exams, one of which was to conduct original research, a proposal and its defense, more original research for the dissertation and its defense, not to mention the ethics training and approval procedures compliance with human subjects research. I also applied for at least a dozen grants throughout to make sure I could offer incentives to research participants after learning how difficult it is to recruit without. I'm not the type to insist everyone I know call me Dr. now, but you better believe I will use that title when it's appropriate. The Ed.D. is similarly rigorous. Something tells me the author knew he couldn't hack it and is bitter towards those who can and did. "
G Shiner,"Before I unload on you, know I have a STEM Ph.D. I think you need a reality check.  Your struggles are no greater than anyone else's in life.  Your Ph.D. title has little meaning outside of social sciences, and the fact you ""worked hard"" over 6 years to earn it means diddly-squat.  Lots of people work hard.  In modern America, a ""doctor"" is someone with a medical degree.  Its prestigious in some ways because to get into any allopathic, American,  medical school is very hard (much harder than typical  PhD programs) and M.D.'s  take multiple exams for licensing and professional standards that Ph.D.'s simply don't.  As such, ""Dr."" is an identification for a profession, and otherwise only formally used in academic settings for non-M.D.s.  I think any Ph.D. who uses the title outside of formality seems to be happy to fool others into thinking they are an M.D.; even most newspapers will not identify someone as a ""Dr"" without a medical degree.   Its confusing otherwise.    "
John McGarry,"When Joe and Jill went to Naval Observatory in January of 2009, Lynne Cheney graciously greeted them at the front door of their new home: ""Vice President and Mrs. Biden, so nice to finally meet you.""  Jill responded curtly: ""Doctor Biden.""  That is what the article is about: her pretentiousness, insecurity, and, in that case, rudeness.  The spouse of a man who struggles to pronounce the names of his new cabinet might cut others slack if her degree is occasionally overlooked."
Michael Welch,I wonder if she is related to  Lt. Colonel Vindman.
David Hemmings,"The author's pettiness is through the roof. I bet he doesn't mind using the title with the likes of Sebastian Gorka.

 "
Andrew Latham,Look up the etymology of the word 'doctor.' Then ask which profession it properly applies to. Then look up the (very short) history of its application to physicians. You don't need a doctorate to do these simple things. 
Alex Kons,"Mr Epstein, do you frequently find yourself shaking your fist at clouds?"
William Horan,"Lots of reasons to take issue with the need for this piece as well articulated by many commentators.  However, not knowing much about Jill Biden before this year, when I heard her introduced as Dr. I assumed she was an MD.  In my view, there's a certain insecurity surrounding someone not an MD who goes by or is referred to by others as Dr.  "
martha potiriades,"I also thought Jill B must be a physician.  That title should be ltd to medical doctors. Thousands of people are Ph.Ds however 99% of them do not use this title. As the author correctly points out, the entire degree has been hopelessly diluted by the abject lack of standards. That Jill B. insists on this, even rudely ""corrects"" nice people who dare call her ""Mrs. Biden"" is unnecessary, condescending and weird. "
LYNN MYERS,"Even worse we have turned our medical care system to a bunch of politicians-mainly attorneys,  who became attorneys because they could not pass eighth grade science. Then they make  key decisions based upon argument...not medical science.  Now we see the result."
HOWARD M GREENBERG,"I don't mind the title, but let's not kid ourselves - she may well be the mastermind behind Joe's election and quick step-down,she lives with the man, I am QUITE CERTAIN she's aware of his obvious mental condition.She likely cut a deal with the Democrats to give him his final professional wish, hand on bible Jan 20, Adios, home to relax and play with the dog by...April?  I give it until April.I think Jill is the quiet negotiator, far from innocent.With all that newfound wealth, a face and neck lift is in order, Jillie.  You need it"
Peter Kranzler,"His ""obvious mental condition"" is that he is far, far sharper than the guy who he replaced.  That's one reason why he won a decisive victory."
SJ Sherman,"Is this the same Dr who officers questioned when she  was 'driving' her ex-husband's 'Vette, when she and Joe were enjoying each other's company?  "
Robert Robins,"The first and last paragraph of this 9 paragraph piece address Dr. Jill Biden's terminal degree. The intervening SEVEN center on the author's inner conflict about perceptions of his personal academic accomplishment and his shortcomings, but mostly are concerned with what most readers (all?) already know. That honorary doctorates don't connote the same academic rigor as real ones.But what does that have to do with Jill Biden? Nothing. In the end, I would not have read an article titled ""Honorary degrees are not academic ones"" and have to conclude, along with other commenters, that this article was simply an effort to denigrate the first-lady-elect's academic accomplishments by linking them to the wholly unrelated topic of honorary degrees.  Seriously weak stuff, Mr. Epstein."
G Shiner,I disagree - I think its a character flaw.  
John McGarry,"Joe has a juris doctorate, albeit after lifting five pages verbatim from a law review article and submitting it as his own work and finishing near the very bottom of his class at a fifth tier law school and never practicing law.  Should we call him Dr. Biden as well or will The Big Guy suffice?"
Peter Kranzler,Mr. President is the correct way to address him.
William Watson,Sad but true.
Sven-Eric Jordt,Still better than the current office older whose daddy paid someone else to sit for his SAT. 
LYNN MYERS,To be plain..Joe Biden cheated in law school.
Brandon Bell,"I am shocked that the editorial staff at WSJ would let this out the doors and be published. This is a disgraceful article that provides zero value to your organization, let alone to me as a reader."
Patrick McNally,The worst teacher I ever had was an Ed.D.  He didn't come to class.  The class was taught by a teacher's aide.
Jennifer Rudd,"This is bizarre and wholly unnecessary commentary.  Also, would have a bit more weight coming from someone with an actual  Ph.D. , rather than someone who obtained an undergraduate degree granted in absentia?  Mr. Epstein,  are you aware that lawyers obtain a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree?  Lawyers use esquire.  Do you take issue with that as well?"
Nancy Hoffman,You come across as a man who is intimidated by a well educated accomplished woman. Or did I miss something?
Kevin Sorrentino,yes. You missed something.
Patrick McNally,"Check your dictionary.  The  first definition of doctor is ""teacher.""Still, pharmacists are doctors, audiologists are doctors, physical therapists are doctors, nurses can be two kinds of doctors.  Optometrists are now optometric physicians.  A PhD advances the frontiers of knowledge.   An MD is achieved with a tremendous amount of memorization..An MD is not a PhD.  "
Lee Hoke,"Mr. Epstein taught 30 years at the college level without the credentials to do so.  I am sure he was reminded of it often by those who paid their dues to be there.  Being called ""Mr."" Epstein must really have bothered him and he is a little bitter about it.  Do the course work, pass your comprehensive exams and then write a thesis.  After that, offer your opinion on whether people have earned the title.  "
Virginia Tucker,"A doctorate is a doctorate, and she is not a character on a children's show. Show some respect, and call Dr. Biden by the title she has earned. Incidentally, I don't insist on being called Dr., though I took my Ph.D.  from UVA (though [clutching pearls] does it count if no one worried I might faint during my exams?). My title has often been erased by people who made the choice for me based on the dated and embarrassingly gendered notions of professional modesty that Mr. Joseph is peddling here.  Let's give the man some of the shamefully unacknowledged credit he's earned all these years: Good for you for not fraudulently claiming to be Dr. Anything. "
F C,"Cannot speak for anybody else's experience, but when I was in my undergrad I called people with PhDs in anthropology, STEM, and social sciences ""doctor"" when referring to them. I don't think anyone who is educated has understood the term, from the latin docere (to teach),  to mean a physician with them. Now I am in my last year of medical school, working for the last 3 to get the degree that supposedly confers the legitimate title of ""doctor,"" and I can truly not understand the snobbery around the use of the term on this article. Never met an actual MD who partakes on this condescension toward PhDs or EdDs either. In spirit, this seems to me like some attempt to be mean to undermine the observation that the FLOTUS title is about to move from a model with decades of experience in the fashion world to an educator with decades of experience teaching folks in her community. The people who complain about liberal condescension toward Trump's base would do well to listen to themselves. "

LUIS CESPEDES,"A bit of humor, a joke told by a Ph Professor the first day of classes.  ""The young son of a Ph Professor answered the phone, to a question from the caller, is the Dr there? he answered yes, but he is the kind of Dr that doesn't do any good to anybody"". I believe Physicians are called Drs mainly for the unique expertise they offer to relieve human suffering, the length and complexity of their studies. To be called a Dr implies a number of requirements that have to be followed. I don't know about how Mrs Biden acquired hers. But Mr Epstein usually writes meaningful and well researched articles. Fake titles are nothing new, Mr Obama, has been called a Professor at the University of Chicago, I have been in academics, I know what it takes to become a Professor."
Steven Pettinga,"PHDs and Dr's are  interchangeable in some respects and totally different in others.  They used to have cashe;  but like the Nobel Prizes, some of those who get to affix these badges to their names diminish their real value. My Father,  Dr. Cornelius Pettinga, who as head Research at Eli Lilly, was instrumental in the development of synthetic insulin (Humulin), Prozac, & Darvon.  He was a Dr. of Chemistry and philosophy.  I have known several ""Dr's"" that really should not have qualified.  Doctors who go to Medical School but choose not to go through residency are PHDs, but many will call themselves Doctors.  Bill Cosby, a Doctor; ha.

Sure, calling her ""Dr. Biden"" rather than ""Mrs. Biden"" may rub traditionalists the wrong way (she's a professional woman, not a demure, adoring wife). And sure, an EdD is different from a PhD or a JD or an MD -- but these are all doctorates, and if someone who's earned one would like to be called by that title, so be it; they have, in fact, earned it. President Trump likes to remind people that he got an MBA from Wharton, and nobody seems to think that's pretentious or undeserved (and I'm pretty sure that if he had a doctorate, he would want people to use it when they're not addressing him as president). This column, and the comments, are nothing but the proverbial tempest in a tea cup. Don't we really have more important things to worry about? "
Jeffrey Hoeber,Agreed... but correction trump didn't get an mba. Just an undergrad and was a transfer student because prob couldn't get in with lackluster hs grades
Brent Stahl,What a silly article.   I hope Mr. Epstein can rest easier now.
Kristina Bell,"Someone who has an honorary doctorate and has no idea what doctoral coursework entails tries to claim that the only doctorate worth acknowledging is a medical doctorate? Much of the rigor he describes of early doctorate programs is still the norm (written exams, oral exams, dissertation, oral defense), with the exception of having to learn Greek and Latin (because why do we need that)? The author  hints that Dr. Biden's dissertation work lacks rigor just because of its title.  I am curious to know whether the title's clear wording or the fact that it examines community colleges is the reason why he finds it uninspiring.  If you want to study her research, read her work and pay attention to what other scholars in her field say about it. I just recently signed up for a WSJ subscription and cancelled it after reading this opinion piece. I love reading different perspectives, but this one is poorly researched and argued. "
John Fahrenholz,"Pathetic.My initial steps during my undergraduate journey were in secondary math education.

Harold Nahigian,"Achievement of the research degree, the PhD, has meaning, particularly to the teaching profession.  It means the individual is not just a practitioner but also a scholar.  That Mr. Epstein did not bother to do the unique, creative, knowledge producing work, judged by his superiors, to earn a PhD should not preclude those who did from using their credential. And for MD snobs:  the term ""Dr.""   stems from the PhD.  Medical doctors had to fight to appropriate that term not so long ago. A little historical knowledge can go a long way. "

Robert Dieter,"I first encountered this when my children started school in Boulder., Colorado.  A few principals used the title ""Dr.""  I guess it was because Boulder was a university town.   Because my father was a medical doctor, I found this affectation petty and pretentious."

Jose Ramos,"Epstein's  piece is a  thinly veiled  attempt at insult humor. He's  mean spirited and attempts to chauvinistically put women in their place.  Prior to Epstein's stale attempts at humor, I considered buying one of his books. My wife talked me out of it.
 
 Epstein is jealous when women have more power than he does. Rather than respecting  Jill Biden for earning a graduate, doctorate level degree from the accredited University of Delaware- a higher level of education than Epstein has, he attempts to devalue Dr. Biden.
 
 Further, Mr. Epstein insults Billie Jean King's 2017 commencement speech at Northwestern, apparently as an example of the ""low quality"" of such speakers. He fails to consider that not only is King an elite athlete, but also she's a champion of equity, fair pay and civil rights. Consider the generations of girls and women she inspired.
 
 He sounds more like Jeffrey Epstein, than an honorable vet &  professional. For Epstein, ""op-ed' means opposed to education-at least for women.
 
"
Amanda Krause,"Agreed. I was just about to write a similar comment when I saw yours. I have a Doctorate from the University of Missouri. The fact that it is not in medicine doesn't discredit the degree; the fact that people don't understand how many doctoral degrees are possible is a problem with our education system, not the degrees themselves."
Chelsea King,"Thank God for these comments - I read this opinion piece this morning and felt very angry at Mr. Epstein's lack of research and respect for people who have gone through the process of earning a doctorate. Having just received my own Ph.D. in the humanities, I took this one a little personally :). "
G Shiner,"I have two doctorates, including the real one, and never demand people call me by either of my well deserved titles .  If you insist on everyday people calling you ""Doctor"" for a PhD in English or Jazz History or something, I'd make fun of you too."
Jennifer Rudd,Thank goodness for the comments.  I am glad I'm not the only one who saw this as offensive and small-minded.
C O,"Like the next First Lady I earned my doctorate 15 years ago. I passed exams in French, German and Latin. I took three written comprehensive exams in ancient, medieval and early modern history and an oral exam in 19th and 20th century American history, the broad subject matter of my research. I successfully defended my 250 page dissertation in person before a committee of five professors. I am not going to express an opinion on whether or when I or Jill Biden or anyone with an earned doctorate should use an honorific or list their credentials. But those decisions are ours and ours alone, notwithstanding the petty, snarky musings of some twit who doesn't even have a graduate degree and obviously suffers from an academic inferiority complex."
Al Stevers,"""Dr. Jill Biden "" sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic""..That right there pretty much sums up the whole Biden crime family."
Steve Davis,"Wow. What a thoroughly patronizing, off-the-mark column this turned out to be. Firstly, medical doctors stole the title from universities, not the other way around. Jill Biden has a D.Ed., which I personally don't have a ton of respect for because it typically is the form-filler for principals and county-level superintendents, but she earned it and she's entitled to the title, just like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell are entitled to claim they are lawyers, in spite of not being able to argue themselves out of a wet paper brief."

Why would the WSJ publish such a petty piece from someone who has obviously suffered professional jealousy for the 30 years he has taught at a prestigious university ""without a doctorate or any advanced degree""?  Rather than trying to embarrass or humiliate our very classy future First Lady perhaps ""Professor Epstein"" should go get those advanced degrees that others have worked so hard to receive.  And, by the way, what message is Northwestern sending to its students if it has allowed someone as ""small"" as Professor Joe to continue all these years without ""any advanced degree""?  Is it okay to ""skate"" through an entire career?  Apparently the answer is ""yes."""
Nahrissa Rush,I was thinking too that what kind of education are students at Northwestern getting from a lecturer (not a professor) who doesn't even have an M.A. in their field and who is so petty and spiteful?

Jen Tilnett,Outlining the degradation of scholastic achievements pushed by fake degrees in the for profit schools is only the tip of subversion. Who is driving down the intel quotient? Liberals and those that fund the fools.

Diane Thorton,"There IS quite a bit of difference between the two designations:""The Ph.D. degree (in any field) is a competency-based degree, whereas the D.Ed. is a credit-based degree.  That is, the D.Ed. requires students to complete a minimum of 60 credit hours beyond a master's degree, or a minimum of 90 credit hours if a master's degree has not already been earned.  This includes a minimum of 15 credit hours of dissertation research.  In contrast, the Ph.D. requires that students fulfill a residency requirement of two consecutive semesters of fully time study, maintain continuous enrollment during the dissertation phase, and successfully demonstrate particular research competencies, most notably in their dissertations."""
Melanie Johnson,"Firstly, this is a very broad view. Total coursework hours vary depending on the program you are in, and the university that you get the doctorate from. Ed Ds can be as rigorous as a Ph D program. But it is true that Ed Ds frequently take less time to complete.  The reason  for this is because an Ed D is considered a more practical degree; IE you are meant to apply the theory you learn while completing the degree to your professional practice, and you are expected to be able to draw upon your years of career experience. In contrast, PhDs are more theoretical; IE, theory - based. They assume limited  to no practical experience in the field and that you will be focusing more on theory and research rather than practical application.It's odd that a group that often rails against 'academic elitism' would sneer at a degree frequently completed by working professionals because it is not academically pure enough for them.

Robert Camm,"Great essay. Anyone involved in education knows that an ""education doctorate"" is the most laughable honorific  ever created. "
Michael Gordon,Barefoot and pregnant is that how the author likes women.
ROBERT SARTINI,How could you conclude that?  Says more about you than him.
Owen Humpage,"Wow Joe, for a guy who hates being called Dr. you sure went a long way to tell us how tough it was to get your Ph.D. and by implication how smart you really are!  Latin and Greek!  I'll bet that has proven useful.  This letted does not reflect well on you education or innate wisdom.  Next time, show it to an average Joe or Jill,  and maybe he or she can tell you what swarmy means.  "
William Mackey,"Look, a college education is the Arts has been dumbed down over the years.  Every half baked college today is now a 'University""."
JENNIFER WELLBORN,"The article explains what it used to take to get a Ph. D, and definitely states that Mr. Epstein does not hold one.   By implication your-comment clearly indicates that you did not learn to read, which clearly does not reflect well on your education or innate wisdom."
James Mitchell,"Petty article and petty response from all of you who have no idea the level commitment and dedication it takes to earn a doctorate. Let me just repeat the word ""earn"".  A doctorate is not given but earn through hard work and academic achievement.  If some one wishes to call themselves Dr. then they are entitled to.  Everything has become tribal , political, and divisive.  Next thing you know the wsj will have an opinion piece on hand razor vs. electric razor what it says about President Elect Biden's policy inclination. Shame on the wsj for encouraging this dribble."
Robert Camm,Nonsense.  Doctorates in Education were created to give the impression that one is somehow intellectually competent.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Want proof?  Look at how many school superintendents (of failing districts) require they be addressed as Dr.  this or that.  The degree is a joke. 
Jerome Abernathy,"""Doctorates in Education were created to give the impression that one is somehow intellectually competent.""How would you know one way or the other?"
MORGAN MERMAGEN,"I am an avid reader of the WSJ opinion pages due to the intellectual rigor applied to the topic at hand.  I am, however, shocked that the WSJ could not find something better to publish than an attack on a woman who actually took the time and spent the hours required to achieve a PhD.  If this were the first gentleman, no one would have blinked at  his title.   While Mr Epstein indeed takes the time to laugh at everyone who uses the title in such circumstances, the impetus for his opinion is clearly driven by the presence of a woman (not a man) in such a public role doing so.   This is disappointing, and the WSJ editorial staff should be embarrassed for having lowered the bar to allow it on their pages."
Dave West,She did not earn a PhD. 
Michael Frankel,"Is the use of this exaggerated misleading title not symptomatic of our brave new world?  The media will no doubt ""Have a Bad Case of Loving"" Dr Jill."
Kent Kraus,Phooey.  What a trivial subject to get excited about.  The academic Phd as an academic title came along way before medical PhD.

Diane Thorton,"Yes, he has a clue.  They're quite a bit different.  I posted this above so apologies for the re-post, but it's very enlightening:""The Ph.D. degree (in any field) is a competency-based degree, whereas the D.Ed. is a credit-based degree.

Jerome Abernathy,"Where did you cut and paste that from?  I don't even recall needing class credits.  You sit for the written qualifier exam, you take an oral qualifier exam, you write a dissertation, and you defend it.  The written qualifier you take in your first or second year of grad school- it's primarily a diagnostic.  The oral qualifier, which you take about the time you're finishing your masters and decided that you want to continue on, is the real gate."
Melanie Johnson,"Cutting and pasting doesn't make you an expert.  There are people who actually have lived familiarity with these degrees and understand them. I responded to your comment upthread, but here I will say, while different doctoral programs have different requirements, someone who completes a doctoral program, whether in medicine, science, education or philosophy,  has earned a doctorate.  If you have earned a doctorate, in general, you can use the term 'doctor.' "
Donna Maria Ticchi,"I  worked in higher education for my entire career.  In my experience working with academic professionals at top-flight universities, this is the way it works title-wise.A person with a faculty appointment  is called ""Professor"" or ""Dr."" at their university and in professional academic settings - such as conferences.   An academic professional without a faculty appointment but with an earned doctorate is called ""Dr."" at their university and in professional academic settings.  So, in the classroom, Jill Biden would use ""Professor"" or ""Dr.,"" depending on the nature of her appointment at her institution of higher learning.Outside of a university or professional academic environment, a person who insists that their degree be used as a form of address would be considered a pretentious and/or insecure person seeking to make themselves out to be greater than they are."
Jerome Abernathy,"""Outside of a university or professional academic environment, a person who insists that their degree be used as a form of address would be considered a pretentious and/or insecure person seeking to make themselves out to be greater than they are.""Meh.  I think it's fine to use PhD after your name in nonacademic settings.  People in education use ""Dr"" more than other fields.  I have no issue with that."
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Jerome - I have no problem with using Ph.D. or D. Ed. (Jill's degree) AFTER one's name - say on stationery or a business card, if it is an earned degree.   However, to insist on being ADDRESSED  or referred to as ""Dr.""  outside of an academic environment - as Jill Biden does - is considered pretentious by those in the academy.   It is the academic equivalent of a vanity plate.Joseph Epstein, a member of the academy, is spot on in his analysis.  Epstein is not picking on Jill or making a political statement.  He is simply telling it like it is."
Jerome Abernathy,"""Joseph Epstein, a member of the academy, is spot on in his analysis.  Epstein is not picking on Jill or making a political statement.  He is simply telling it like it is.""Speaking of pretentious, ""member of the academy""?  Is that what an adjunct professor is called?"
Donna Maria Ticchi,"Yes, I believe that an adjunct professor can speak as a ""member of the academy,"" if they hold the appropriate appointment at an academic institution.More to the point, Is Jill Biden an adjunct professor?  "
Jerome Abernathy,"Jill Biden teaches at a community college in Northern Virginia.  She earned her doctorate and it is appropriate in education that she refers to herself as ""Dr."".  The superintendent of our local school district is ""Dr. Johnson"".  I address her as Dr. Johnson. "
bruce miller,"Mediocrities love their titles; the more mediocre the more they demand the honorific.      The ""party of science"" may swoon about ""Dr."" Jill Biden.    The rest of us see through the quackery and pretension.     In matters great and small, the only response to the multiple frauds of the ""Biden Administration"" is a vigorous resistance."
Elizabeth Solomon,"I don't remember many specifics in my education classes but I do remember a couple.  One whole semester class was devoted to teaching the children to not take responsibility for their actions lest their self esteem be damaged.  The other instance was two different classes taught by the same teacher with different class descriptions and different class numbers (ie 103 and 235) which were the exact same class.  I took very good notes, writing every word from her mouth, they were the same class.  This was not just a community college, it is a well known respected school.  The students I would have been teaching are the parents of the woke today."
edward hilton,"Judging from the commentary, there must be a lot of readers who dared not admit to holding the doctorate in their trenchant responses.Basically, it seems that it is just one more morph in the meaning of a term as the subject became more and more common. The PhD, once signifying Doctor of Philosophy is today nothing more than a warning that the holder suffers from Permanent Hubris Disorder."
Jacob Maczuga,"I used to work in a Children's Hospital as a lab tech.  Our supervisor, a Ph.D, requested that we refer to him as Doctor because all the others associated with our lab were Perinatologists, i.e. REAL DOCTORS of Maternal/Fetal medicine.  It got to the point where none of us in the lab ever called him doctor,.  He got so flummoxed with us that he ended up telling us to call him ""Hey You!"", which we gladly and giddily did!"
bruce miller,"I hold a Juris Doctorate.    Do I demand to be called ""Doctor?""    Heck, I'm just glad not be called the usual slurs about lawyers.    ""Dr."" Jill.        Give me a break.      A parvenu with pretensions of adequacy.  "
WILLIAM BURKE,"Mr Epstein. What a petty article.  Whether Mrs Biden is called DR or not , I do not care.One thing for sure, she has more brains on the tip of her finger then Mellania has in her whole body."
Lee E,Does Ms. Biden also speak four languages?  Hmm...
Elizabeth Solomon,How could you possibly know anything about Melania since she was never interviewed and not one magazine cover.  We found out far more about michelles toned arms in 5 minutes than even one positive thing about Melania.
WILLIAM BURKE,"Elizabeth, she was afraid if being exposed as the dummy she is."
Robert Fraina,What an incredible example of lack of class. 
Jerome Abernathy,"Michelle went to Princeton undergrad, then Harvard Law.  She had interesting things to say.  Melania on the other hand..."
Michael Meriwether,And you know both of them personally to be able to make such a judgment?
Lee E,"This made my day, Mr. Epstein.  So wonderfully written and spot-on true.  Add dentists to this list of doctor posers and you'll cover all of the bases."
Pauline King,"Mean spirited making fun of an accomplished woman is a great way to start the day, says LE"
Robert Davis,Keep in mind that Whoopee Goldberg announced that Ms. Biden was a great doctor (MD) until one of the panel mentioned she was not not an MD.
Jeffrey Lynch,In particular if she makes comments about the pandemic as Dr Biden this is academically fraudulent.
Pauline King,Wow. What a sexist essay. I couldn't quite believe it as I read further in growing disbelief to the full disrespectful end. Get a grip Mr. Epstein. 
Lee E,"""I will not tolerate your intolerance"" says PK."
James Stimson,"For male teachers at any level elementary, secondarary, or uniiversity the only really prestigioustitle is Mr.....I believe this !"
Robert Sansone,"There's an episode of the radio show about car difficulties (""Click and Clack"" where the radio hosts are actually both PHD's from MIT who run a car repair business in Cambridge, MA) advise a pretentious caller who is also a PHD and refers to himself as Doctor when identifying himself, to stop doing that.Their reason for urging this pretentious PhD caller to stop is fabulous:They explain when he is flying in coach and the plumber in first class has a heart attack ,and the crew looks  up the manifest to find if there's a doctor on board, they'll seek him out. His use of the doctor title as a Phd is going to get him in trouble and the plumber in further difficulty for wasting the crews time. Biden's (formerly babysitter) wife needs to lose the use of this pretentious title."
Michael Welch,"I used to enjoy that show.  Another Boston radio host of that error was David Brudnoy, who held a PhD from Yale, but never referred to himself as ""Doctor"" on air."
Cynthia Bond,That was the best radio show ever.  Looked forward to driving around on Saturday just to listen to them.
Gene Howard,"Mr Epstein I feel sorry for you.  What a sad way to go through life, so bitter and pathetic.  And I can't fathom why WSJ felt that this was an opinion fit to print."
Scooter Brown,"Impossible to take anyone seriously that stands behind a podium with the inscription ""Office of the President Elect""."

Michael Concino,I'm shocked!!! How dare you!!!
Warren Beeton,"What a small minded, pathetic, op-Ed.  And The WSJ opinion pages pay no attention to the SCOTUS rulings putting a stop to the attempted coup by Trump.  All because Gerard Baker and his minions are Trump sycophants, not honest opinion writers  that serve the interests of their readers. "
Edward Brading,"The Peanuts cartoon from 12/22/74 has Snoopy typing a story, ""The Gift,"" while sitting atop his doghouse: It was the holiday season.  She and her husband had decided to attend a performance of King Lear.  It was their first night out together in months.  During the second act one of the performers became ill.  The manager of the theater walked onto the stage, and asked, ""Is there a doctor in the house?""  Her husband stood up, and shouted, ""I have an honorary degree from Anderson College!""  It was at that moment when she decided not to get him anything for Christmas.Mr. Epstein's piece is the long speech,  Mr. Schulz's cartoon the short."
Richard Murphy,"Sorry Jill -- an Ed.D is sort of the bottom of the academic food chain.  And we now have the ability to earn on-line Ph.D's -- in short anyone who wants to be called Dr. can find a way to attain a degree somewhere.  When I was in grad school, the faculty was eager to throw out students who didn't meet their standards but those days have evaporated.  If you can find someone who is smart enough and is willing to throw away critical career development years studying esoterica that no one cares about -- no faculty member is going to kick out such a student --- particularly if they can run errands.  "
Glen Blackmon,"When I bought my last house. the selling agent's business card had Ph. D. after his name. He was a retired US Army senior (not sure what pay grade) sergeant. I was impressed enough to ask him where he'd matriculated.The air left the balloon immediately when he named an on-line university.So long, Dr. Hello , Jim (or whatever your name is)."
Jerome Abernathy,"""Sorry Jill -- an Ed.D is sort of the bottom of the academic food chain.""She's a huge step up from Melania..."
Jim Holmberg,"How many languages does Jill speak?I know she speaks at least one more than Joe, Jer."
Jim Holmberg,And a huge step up from Joe.I'll go out on a limb and bet that Jill didn't have to cheat to finish in the bottom ten percent of her doctoral class.
Jim Holmberg,I'd say a Ph. D. in critical race theory is far below an Ed. D.
David Scott,"I don't disagree with the author per se, but I wonder if her silly use of ""Dr."" in front of her name is worthy of a Wall Street Journal editorial.  It very much comes across as small time ankle biting.  I guess I expect better than this from the WSJ."
Fred Scott,Says wonders about one's ego when they have a PHD and want to be referred to as a Doctor especially a PHD in education.
RSE K,"The erosion of truth and knowledge is proceeding rapidly at the WSJ. A doctorate in education is a valuable and hard-earned degree, and far different from an honorary degree, which should not be used as a title. And plenty of medical doctor degrees are very easy to obtain. This opinion article is nothing more than to diminish the spouse of someone the WSJ does not support politically. I would imagine the same people cannot understand why Melania Trump is not a Harvard Professor."
DON ROSS,"Please provide any listing of medical degrees in the U.S. that are ""very easy to obtain"".  My daughter and son-in-law are now Medical Doctors, both had very strong undergraduate credentials from prestigious universities, as well as very high test scores, yet being accepted into any medical school was a challenging and arduous task, as was the subsequent medical school curriculum and their Board certification process.  As for truth and knowledge eroding, if you'd like to compare the intellectual capacity of that process with any degree in lower or higher Education, including one with a  dissertation focused on Community Colleges, I can only hope you'll join our weekly high-stakes poker game, where we have a special seat reserved, which also comes with a ""free"" fish fry!"
Thomas Kemp,It brings to mind how easily we throw around the title of President.
M Buonincontro,"No opinion piece from the editorial board on the Supreme Court's decision regarding the Texas AG's lawsuit, but room enough to opine on this momentous topic? Pathetic."

DAREN D MILLER,Thank you Mr. Epstein.  The high and mighty Bidens.  
Robert Pociask,"Years ago, my children endured a HS teacher who insisted on being addressed as Dr. because she was an attorney with her J.D.it is pretension, pure and simple.  I work with scores of Ph.D. holders, and by and large they use the honorific in their letterhead only. Self-confidence in brilliant people is a marvelous thing. "
Rob Joseph,I actually received a resume  from someone who has been in the work force for 21 years and he had Cum Laude listed beside his name.  I hit the delete key. 
C ANDREW FLEMING,"I have a M.D. degree.  I never use it or the designation ""Dr."" unless it's in a medical setting or context.  If I'm at a hospital, it's ""Dr."", if I'm checking in at a hotel it's ""Mr."".  I've noticed that the usage of ""Dr."" by PhD recipients is most common in the educational world, but even in the medical world we have administrators that want to be referred to as Dr., and we have nurses with advanced degrees that want to use the title ""Dr."", which can create considerable confusion."
carol person,"You don't think Jill Biden should prefer to be called  Dr. Biden?  You find it arrogant and pretentious? Then don't call her Dr. Biden.    I, for example, choose to call the man in the White House Trump, not President Trump. "
Rob Joseph,Exactly. I choose not to even recognize Biden period. 
Thomas Kemp,"And there my friends is the motivation behind ""Mr."" Epstein's Op-Ed."
Eric LeFrancois,"Yes, Carol, I have been struck by the meanness of mind prevalent in those with TDS.  I didn't vote for President Obama, but during his tenure I never denied he was my president, and I never called him anything but President Obama.We MUST return civics to the class room and civility to our discourse."
Peter DeFonzo,Not only civics but  civility 
Todd Cooper,"It's interesting that you feel so threatened by this. A doctorate is a doctorate regardless of the field of study. She earned it. Equating it your unearned honorific is absurd, and to go further into debasing all PhDs is to deny any credibility and authority of knowledge.  Huh. Gee wonder why you would want to do that.  Not all doctorates are the same. Granted.  Not all experts are credible. Granted. A doctorate is not a pathway to instant credibility. Granted. However, they earned it. Respect that. And stop being jealous. "
bill healy,Well said. 
Cary Kozberg,"MR Cooper, I promise you that Joseph Epstein is not jealous or threatened.His erudite and prolific writing has had tons more influence on thinking Americans than Jill Biden's or most any other person with the honorific he discusses."
Thomas Kemp,And so?
Rob Joseph,And so he answered the comment. Did you miss something?
Thomas Kemp,Not sure Rob. Does that have anything to do with Jill Biden's earned salutation?
Marco Mazzucco,"I have a PhD in mathematics which I only mention so that one doesn't waste their time telling me I'm jealous of Jill.  I find Epstein's comments spot on.  I always considered people who insist on using the title ""Dr."" having some sort of insecurity complex. Knowledge should speak for itself, it doesn't need to be affirmed by a title.  Who ever heard of Dr. Einstein?  "
Matt Norton,"Let's re-do the acronyms... 'Dr of Medicine can be come 'DoM,' Dr of Education becomes a 'DoE', Dr of Business becomes 'DoB'. Although I shudder to think of hearing 'The dom will see you now'..."
Joseph Comfort,"My prediction:   The ""doc"" will be out of the White House in maybe 6 months when hubby steps down for ""health"" reasons and Kamala will assume the position.   J. Comfort MD"
Thomas Kemp,"And that ""Joe"" is the not so compelling reason behind this Op-Ed...taking a shot at the Biden's."
Eric LeFrancois,AWESOME!  Loved the valediction!
David Townshend,Were Jill a real medical doctor she would know that Joe needs some serious medical attention.
Thomas Kemp,"Wait for it...ah yes, a political cheap shot...nice!"
David Townshend,Wait for it...Kamala will be President within 12 months.
Thomas Kemp,I would take that bet
Thomas Kemp,"I will gladly assign ""Dr."" to the brilliant researchers and scientists that have brought what will soon be six vaccines to eradicate our global pandemic."
Ron B,"I couldn't agree more.  Getting a PhD is an accomplishment, but telling people about that accomplishment every time you introduce yourself (or worse still, forcing them to acknowledge it when they address you) is raw arrogance and braggadocio. "
Thomas Kemp,"Who's ""telling people""?  I have not once heard any self-promotion from Jill Biden."
Dan Hughes,"The known fact that ""Dr. Jill Biden"" is frequently heard is an excellent clue. Although I can't supply a quote, I recall hearing/reading that she prefers/encourages the usage."
Thomas Kemp,"Show us Dan.  I have only heard the reference from media...oh, and now ""Mr."" Epstein."
Steven Weisbrod,"I have one of those degrees (not  honorary), and I never have used the doc. I agree completely with Mr. Epstein. I even have trouble referring to a dentist as doc. I reserve it for the medical profession."
Thomas Kemp,"I don't understand.  Why at this moment do we think the salutation of ""Dr."" is reserved only for MD's?  It has been this way forever and yet now we want to pick on Jill Biden?  Sounds more like a politically motivated Op-Ed.  I'm curious who ""Mr."" Epstein voted for...anyone else?"
Stefano C,So the man who doesn't have a doctoral degree tells the woman who does - and has used that degree to full effect by continuing to teach even while serving as SLOTUS  -  that it makes him uncomfortable. The only grievance I hear is the author's inferiority about not having letters to dangle after his own last name. Perhaps he should find a safe space. 
Cary Kozberg,Stefano-look up Mr. Epstein's cv and you will see he has nothing to be jealous about.The man's writing is devoted to exposing pomposity and promoting authenticity.Do you u know the difference?
Eric LeFrancois,"Served in Washington for years, had to look up SLOTUS -- I thought you'd misspelt a slur on Jill!"
Kevin Shanley,"""Jill Biden should think about dropping the honorific, which feels fraudulent, even comic.""Sooooo... we should think of the Biden's as something other than fraudulent and comic?  Why?"
Mark Alan Harris,"I've never considered anyone other than an M.D., O.D., chiropractor, or dentist a real doctor.  As Mrs. Biden's dissertation title illustrates, most PhDs don't deserve any distinguished titles because they wrote about or researched a topic that 99% of Americans could care less about. Real doctors matter. Few PhDs do  "
Jasmine Lyon,What is YOUR level of education?  At least she's not a doctor of pornography.
George Dodson,"So, ""most PhDs don't deserve any distinguished titles because they wrote about or researched a topic that 99% of Americans could care less about"". Are you serious? Most PhD research topics, including mine, in Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc. fall into your ""could care less"" category. But research in these areas are where the breakthroughs in energy, medicine, materials, manufacturing and the like come from.  This work improves our understanding of the physical universe that we live in and provides toe tools with which we improve our wellbeing. As an example modern medical scanners had their origins as particle detectors in High Energy Physics.    "
Anne Hall," Well, Mr. Dodson, there are degrees, and then there is knowledge, intelligence and wisdom. I am of the opinion that Jill Biden is lacking in the latter areas. I consider her dissertation to be in the couldn't care less category.I learned the difference between the phrase you used and the one I prefer long before I earned my B.A."
KEVIN FARMER,"Not a ""real"" doctor?  Since when is an earned PhD not a real doctor?  All other doctorates are copied after the PhD.  I believe you are implying the title should be reserved to healthcare professionals. You do know that ""doctor"" is latin for ""to teach"" correct?"
Lynn McLinden,"Two of the virtues of American society, in my opinion, are its being fundamentally a meritocracy together with its placing inherent value on each individual. 

The issue Mr. Epstein raises here points to a certain tension between these. 

As to merit, there are considerable gradations of merit possible within any field of human endeavor, including the earning of higher academic degrees. Likewise, beyond the inherent value of each individual one can explore the detailed qualities of that individual's character, integrity, personality and the like. 

The Bidens seem to have self-images on these matters which differ somewhat from my opinion."
T Indy W,"Much ado about nothing.   The Bidens have a lot of baggage, and their mysteriously silent VP, likely soon P,  as well.  How about some Real news?The Ph.D. is the oldest doctorate awarded, from the 13th cent.  Medical experts were  not necessarily holders of the M.D., and in some countries, persons without a doctorate (such as lawyers) are called ""doctor.""  The Ed. D. is a more recent title.mrs"
Christopher Holland,if doctorates go to the likes of Stephen Colbert then I feel no shame about using the title Existential Professor Maximus.
Ray Campbell,"Jill Biden is more of a doctor than Trump is a ""successful businessman.""  "
Christopher Holland,"I think the billions, the palace in Florida and the New York high rise with his name on it says sour grapes to you.  His wife is a looker too."
WILLIAM BURKE,So true Ray.
Lynn McLinden,"If Jill Biden with her Ed. D. degree insists on being ""Dr."" Jill Biden, or if, as perhaps might equally be the case, her husband insists on that, then just as said husband has felt the need to get hair implants, to whiten his teeth and, at an age when most men are content to golf several times a week, has felt moved to ""have some work"" done to preternaturally alter his physical image, then that's their right and choice. 

But these things do color how I think of them."
Jasmine Lyon,"But it was ok when we, the taxpayers, paid for Melania's breast implants.  She's made of 100% plastic.  Jill and Joe are high-class people.  We haven't been used to that for the past 4 years."
David Townshend,High class people.  Now that is laughable.
Tom Caldwell,"I have always thought the intent was to imply that Mrs. Biden is a medical  doctor, and so it always seemed  a little (or a lot) phony,  I would bet if you did a man on the street interview upwards of 75-80% would avow she is a medical Doc.  Just strikes me as a little  pretentious."
Jasmine Lyon,"That was NEVER the intent.  If you had a higher education, I'm sure you would want credit for that.  What's the level of YOUR education?"
bjane behan,Bitterness is not good for ones psyche.
David Townshend,Are you always this angry so early in the morning or is it just your nature?
Robert Oldham,"Well considered and written, Now, prepare to be vilified"
Greg Brown,Decades ago a PhD in Math Ed was granted at Enormous State U for revolutionary work showing some slight difference in math scores depending on the class seating arrangement.  This was the foundation for subsequent ground-breaking research on classroom milieu.  It would be funny if it weren't so patheticIt was one of the earliest signs of what is now obvious:  Public education needs to be done away with (not public support of education however)
Julie Brotje Higgins,"Jill Biden's work and degree confer the honorific she uses.   We may disagree about the worthiness of some fields of examination or even about the people that pursue them but Dr. Biden is entitled to the label she uses.  By explaining how intelligent you are even without academic credentials sadly only highlights your own insecurities, Mr. Epstein.  (And, I hope for the day when the U.S. values the discipline of education as much as it does business.  We'd be better for it.) "
R D,"She probably is a good teacher, but her husband needs her more than her students at this time.  "
R D,She needs to stay with Joe Biden.  He makes mistakes when she's not around to correct him.
Edward Palumbo Jr.,"Makes you wonder if she's going to sit with him all day in the oval office and hold his hand comforting him, and correcting his gaffs. "
Andrzej Gotti,If you have a daughter teach her how to do  old men  .Jil and Kamala  is you model 
Theodore George,"Degrees in Education have always been worthless, a complete joke among the serious disciplines."
Stanley Jones,"She has a bachelor's degree and a doctoral degree from the University of Delaware, as well as master's degrees from West Chester University and Villanova University. So put that in your pipe and smoke it."
Theodore George,"So what. We live in the age of padded resumes and over-rated degrees.  Anyway, the author spoke only of the doctorate in education, not the other degrees.  And he is right.  Ms. Biden  should realize that the vast majority of doctorates even in the ""real"" humanities, much less the low-grade ""Education"" discipline,  dont normally run around calling themselves Dr Steve or Dr Amy, like a TV medical guru.It's embarrassing."
Eric S Ludwig,"Graduate degrees in education ARE resume padding. They get a bump in salary for each one they get.  And they get those masters and doctors in summer school.  Check the GRE scores of the respective fields: physics vis-a-vis education. Do any of those classes in personnel management make the candidates more effective in the classroom? I doubt it. And just FYI, one reason American education so poor is that teachers at the high school level have a BA in the subject, meaning at most three years [more usually two, junior and senior year] in the subject. Then they get post grad 'education' degrees. In Germany, for instance, they START teaching with a subject masters [four to six years in that field]  and a state examination of competence and subject mastery. I'd love to see that here. "
Michael Welch,"My father was an optometrist and held a doctorate. He never referred to himself as doctor except in a professional setting.Now I used to belong to a fraternal organization that had as a member a former school principal that insisted on being called ""doctor"" even among his brothers.   Some said it was in education others said it was only honorary.  A real horse's behind."
Lisa Matovich Brooke,Wow calling Dr. Biden kiddo is condescending.  This article is sexist and rude.   it is a big accomplishment to get a PHD in any field.  What is this old man thinking?
Theodore George,"Please. Education degrees are worthless.  Sure, some paper had to be shuffled, but to compare this to a Ph.D in physics or math or engineering is a joke."
Ronald Richter,"I must have missed your piece on First Lady Melania's anti-bullying campaign, and her efforts to assist children caged at the border.  What a shame we'll have a highly educated First Lady practiced in helping others.  Better to plant roses and defend a despot. Yes, definitely. "
eb mem,Did you also miss the articles about Michelle and her support of her husband who built those cages at the border.  Michelle's contribution to society was introducing children getting free lunch to quinoa.  She believes that macaroni and cheese made with artisan cheese has a different nutritional value than Kraft.
Kit Blumer,Honestly.... why does it even matter?
Matthew A. Selig,"do we really have a current first lady with naked pictures all over the internet?is Republican first lady outrage sincere, or just a pose?"
Sara Stevenson,"I don't think this is funny. It's a huge accomplishment to earn a Phd in any field, and the fact that she earned it at age 55, after raising a family, makes it even more remarkable.  This article is also sexist. Would he write this about a man? I can't believe the WSJ gave this piece  real estate on its op-ed pages.  I'm so proud of Dr. Biden's accomplishments in the field of education. "
Theodore George,"Sorry, it's a meaningless degree."
Eric S Ludwig,"Yes, it is an accomplishment to get a PhD. She has an Ed. D. "
Ryan Dawson,"Imagine thinking that knowing Greek is more deserving of status in our society than dedicating your life to educating our children. Our teachers should be on a pedestal, not kicked down for their legitimate accomplishments and sacrifices. What an embarrassment. "
Sara Stevenson,I am really looking forward to having a teacher in the White House. 
James Rosellini,Many thanks to The Venerable Epstein for another very needed essay. It has occurred that  the ones calling themselves Doctor most often are in possession of the lowly Ed.D. Not surprising.
James Stewart,"I disagree.I am proud of having earned a Doctor of Science degree.  It took me seven years of parttime, evening and weekend study, came after my earlier earning two Master of Science degrees, and my doctoral research language, upon which I was examined, was French.I have spent 20 years living abroad, in Asia and Europe, mostly Germany, where all who have earned doctoral degrees are addressed as doctor.  That includes lawyers.In Germany, medical doctors are known by the German word Arzt.Jill Biden is Dr. Biden to me."
DAVID GROSS,She's not a very good doctor to Joe!
Theodore George,The author wasnt speaking of Ph.D's in hard science.  And Ed.D is an almost worthless degree by comparison.
James Stewart,"Perhaps, you have never been a professional educator.I'm married to one, and through her, I have learned of the work undertaken to further develop education at all levels, from Pre-Kindergarten to adult.Just as in other fields, including science, there is controversy in education - but there is also opportunity for achievement, sometimes recognized by the award of a Doctor of Education degree."
David Nixon,"I sometimes tell people that I have three doctorates, one failed (PhD) and two passed (PhD, DSc). While they were necessary to get a research job, the only one that actually was of benefit was the one I failed as I had to understand the reason. "
Andrew Klein,"I remember the day in 1962 when my corridor master, an Assistant Professor of English Literature at one of our prominent universities, told me that, on that very day, his thesis had been accepted and he finally was getting  his PhD.  As we sat in his little apartment where I learned this startling fact, as a student who had yet to achieve any degree, I watched with  embarrassment as he called  down to the dorm front desk -- just to show me, I think --  introducing himself as ""This is  Doctor ****. ""  He was an extraordinary. teacher before that day and continued as one after.  But it must have meant something profound in the strange world of academia, one I had wanted to one day join at the time.  Coming to my senses, I went on to law school instead, and never  since  have I introduced myself  as "":Doctor""  despite my JD.  The new First Lady  Elect, as it were, should follow that path, introducing herself as herself without the ""Doctor.""  One hopes this is not asking too much of her. "
Stanley Jones,"Many folks will think that you not introducing yourself as Dr, when you could and really should, is a sophisticated form of deceit: attention, if not awe, is drawn to you, by you, as it were, going out of your way to not draw attention to it.Next time, be honest. Tell folks what you really are."
Robert Weyker,"Mr. Epstein may I point out you not having a Ph.D. brings up the question are you just jealous?Now a few stories...A professor of mine was taking a train and  had marked a number of boxes with his ""name"", Dr. Jones. A woman asked him what kind of doctor was he... He responded Mathematics. He said she was so disappointed that he never used ""Doctor"" again.A couple of years ago my youngest son was getting his master's degree. There were a number of students also getting their Ph.D.s I told my oldest son that one of the guys are work dead pans, ""Ph.D., I always thought that was a warning label."" (laugh)  But, I pointed out to my son, that you could only use it if you have a Ph.D. otherwise you sound like you're jealous.I tell people at work at my previous job having a Ph.D. was good for two things, being introduced to a customer as ""Dr. Weyker"" and so that people can give you a hard time about it. At my current job it is only so that people can give you a hard time about it."
Felix Mahoney,"The machinery is already in action. The coverage of Biden family corruption- - Hunter and Joe's brother for starters- - was well known to people who pay attention to these things, but scrubbed into silence by the MSM. Post election, the cat's out of the bag, and the scandal that never-was will drive Joe Biden out of the White House. sanctimonious progressives everywhere will clutch their figurative pearls in horror that the Biden family might have ever been so tainted. Who new??Poor Joe will hang his head in befuddled shame, abandoned to his humiliating  fate, andthen  exit under the face-saving pretense that it's his health.Then comes America's Livia, Kamala. And her ""advisers"" led by The One himself. So ends forever the American experiment. Killed from within. No-fault voting by mail was the murder weapon "
Judy Neuwirth,"This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsThis is the way the world ends Not with a bang, but a whimper- T.S. Eliot"
james wright,"More doctorates are handed out in education than in any other field. It is laughable. Here is how it works. Say you are  a K through 12 teacher and you want to make more money. You go to school on a part time basis while you teach and earn a doctorate. The school district pays for your degree. The teachers college pockets the taxpayer funded tuition. The teachers union contract requires that the teacher gets a raise because she now has a doctorate. The high schools students don't learn any more from a teacher with a doctorate then from a teacher without a doctorate. However the teacher earns more, the taxpayers pay more and the teachers college makes some coin in the process. Then, in the fifties after working 180 days a year for 30 years with no chance of being fired, they retire with pensions with colas and medical insurance. It's a scam."
Steven Chen,"This opinion article tries to belittle Dr. Jill BidenDr. Biden, who started her career in the 1970s, has worked as an English teacher at an adolescent psychiatric hospital, high schools and community colleges, while earning two master's degrees and a doctorate in education along the way.

She didn't quit teaching when her husband served as vice president, returning to the classroom just days after the inauguration. She juggled her two worlds by grading papers on Air Force Two or bringing a change of clothes to work so that she could ""leave from the campus straight to a State Dinner."" When students asked if she was married to the vice president, she would deflect palace intrigue by simply saying she was one of his relatives. .... NYTDr. Jill Biden is truly into EDUCATION Her own education and the education of American students We actually need to have more teachers like her, with better pay, support, respect; after all, the future of this nation depends on good EDUCATION"
Sara Stevenson,"Thank you, Steven! "
Jack Janzen,"I've always considered a doctor in education, a vice president at a bank and a janitor at most other companies at about the same level."
Eric S Ludwig,"If you want to see who makes the most immediate difference in an organization, have one of them miss work for a week. I assure you, the janitor would be missed the second day. "
DOROTHY SANDERS,"People feel they worked for their alphabet soup worth of business card titles, so it makes them feel cheated to give them up. I feel as you do however, that such titles should stay on the business cards unless there is a reason for making formal recognition of a person with all titles due."
Ron Hoelscher,"""I taught at Northwestern University for 30 years without a doctorate or any advanced degree""Apparently you are very sensitive about it or you wouldn't have taken the time to write the snarky column."
Hugo Cunningham,"John Silber, president of Boston University 1971-1996, habitually used his ""doctor"" (PhD) title on public occasions, presumably to buttress the value of PhD degrees earned at B.U.  This invited ridicule when he went into politics, eg running for Governor of Massachusetts in 1990.  It may have been Margery Eagan who said of the notoriously irascible Silber:  ""John Silber may not been an MD, but he could sure tear your tonsils out!"""
Robert Taylor,"Thank you for this Mr Epstein.  I'm sure Jill Biden has many wonderful traits and accomplishments, but adding a ""doctor"" to her name does nothing to improve on this in her case.  As a physician, I don't dwell on being called ""doctor"" but it grates when others use the title without the prerequisites it deserves.  Enjoy your wonderful marriage, the fullness you bring to your family, and the standards you will bring to the White House.  In four years, that will matter a lot more than the letters in front of your name."
Hugo Cunningham,"In Russian, ""doktor"" has been an academic degree, while a physician has been called a ""vrach"".  Exception:  in Stalin's final year, they were called ""ubiitsy v belykh khalatakh"" (""killers in white coats"")."
Jay Campbell,"By harping on Mrs. Biden for her honorific, Mr. Epstein will create an issue that will backfire. Give it up, WSJ, find a better issue. "
Sara Stevenson,"They're petty. Now that they've already made fun of AOC and Goya beans, they try to make fun of the new First Lady for her accomplishments in education. "
DAVID GROSS,They're both Goyas.
James Ransom,"Joseph Epstein is at his usual brilliant self.  He is without doubt the clearest thinker, most down to earth guy that ever was a college prof (if they called him that).  His own brilliance was enough to fill his classroom, I'm sure.  I never miss his essays in the WSJ.  I have quoted him many times.If anybody ever deserved a real advanced degree, it is Joseph Epstein.  I hope accolades from your current students, such as myself, will do instead."
Donna Maria Ticchi,"I agree with Mr. Epstein's suggestion that Jill Biden drop the ""Dr."" title in her new role as First Lady.My professional career in higher education  began as an administrator at MIT, where I had the privilege of working with some of the most brilliant minds in the world.  When I began my job, I asked an older, wiser colleague what the proper form of address was for an MIT  faculty member.  I asked if the title ""Dr."" might be appropriate.  I'll never forget my colleague's response.  He shook his head and said, ""Anyone can be a ""Dr.,"" but not everyone can be an MIT Professor.""  "
Charles Bergst,"The Ed.D of the past half century is pretty worthless, it's usually a sign of a person having greater credentials than substance.   It's part of the hollowing out of education since it's first spasm of #Woke in the '60s.  The people who invented the coronavirus vaccine were mostly Doctors - in the older sense; they had reached the Doctor of Philosophy level in a natural science such as biology or mathematics.  The term meant one who had shown an ability to create original work in their field, not just read and remember. A medical Doctor is different: they are required to reach a high level of competence in applying science, but need not invent or discover any. We should perhaps have different terms for the traditional Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and the vocational Doctor of Medicine. These are different and not even parallel sense of the word 'doctor', which inevitably creates confusion and sometimes resentment.  "
Shelly Wheeler,At least Melania didn't try to be anything other than herself.   Imagine the laughter with Dr. Melania Trump!
Larry Himes,"Joe and Jill are a perfect embellishment couple who are wrapped up in self serving, self angrandizing nonsense trying to make a ordinary accomplishment become an extraordinary achievement and use doctor to imply she is a doctor.  Just like Joe finished at the top of his law class and was on full scholarship.  Lie and lie!  Joe, the ""big guy"" also did not know about Hunter making millions selling influence for access to VP Bidens name and Joe not knowing anything about it.  Lie.  We heard the recording and testimoney that Joe, the ""big guy"" knew what Hunter was doing.  LIE"
David Sturtz,"Now do Trump - including Jared's Harvard degree, Bone Spurs's deferment and Melania's Einstein visa. "
K Katz,"It is hysterically funny watching people like Wendy Osefo of the RHOP insist on being called ""doctor"" ( in her case ""Dr Wendy"" ) even among her friends - although she at least has a PHD from  Hopkins and not a low level degree like an EdD, which is sort of like your pharmacist insisting on being called Dr because of a PharmD. I am a medical doctor and the only time I ever refer to myself as ""Dr"" is when I am working with patients - mostly to reassure them.   It's pretentious to use that title outside of a professional context. "
H C REED,Thank you for sharing your OPINION.
Judy Neuwirth,Just think of the gazillions of attorneys out there that forego using the title 'doctor' even though they obtained a real Juris Doctor degree (unlike Jill's Ed.D).
ROLI ANTONIO,"My observation is, in the last 20 or so years the use of titles has become pervasive. I am an engineer with licenses to practice in multiple states/countries. To enhance my company's professional image I started adding PE, for Professional Engineer, as a suffix to my name only on official company correspondence and documents requiring my name and signature, but not on outside correspondence. I have noticed lately in my orbit that most engineers are now adding the PE suffix.I also have observed lately more widespread use of suffixes previously missing, such as: CPA, CFP, RN, MPA, etc., some I can't decipher what they mean without doing a google search! European colleagues tell me there was a time when titles and honors commanded attention and respect in Europe. Perhaps the thirst for respect, attention, and legitimacy is driving the use of titles in the current age."
Jenny Slade,"I was eager to read this article. I worked as a staff person on a college campus for many years, where the degree-flaunting would make a peacock look humble. But this might be one of the most poorly written opinion pieces I've ever read. Mr. Epstein begins by condescendingly advising Dr. Biden to drop her PhD from her title (which she did earn, by the way, and to which she is entitled, per other commenters, because she does teach.) He offers no specific justification, except to say that her use of Dr.  sounds ""fraudulent and comic."" This is an ironic accusation indeed, coming from a guy who admittedly never earned some of his own honorifics. He then spends the rest of his column bemoaning the *honorary* doctorate: how is that even relevant? Were you trying to delegitimize her by association, Mr. Epstein? You might as well have called Dr. Biden ""little lady."" I fear your old-fashioned bias is showing, Mr. Epstein. "
Jay Janney,"Actually she has a doctorate in education, not a Ph.D."
Charles Bergst,"If you know a few Ed.Ds, you would be negatively impressed by the title. "
Dean Hinnen,"If you have spent many years on a college campus, you should know how fraudulent degrees in education are."
Verne Thibodeaux,"I have a Ph. D.    Outside of the university, I don't wish to be called ""Doctor"".
I believe it is a sign of intellectual insecurity to insist on a title that has a specific meaning in the US.

Ms. Biden should suffice."
G Shiner,"I've got a couple of doctorates, including the ""real"" one.  20+ years since my first one I still get weirded out when called that outside the office. Only once did I ask that my title be used, and that was on a written list of participants at a wedding where everyone was identified as ""Mr."" or ""Dr.""; and by not including either (the groom thought I was too close to the family for a title), I had the same non-title as children in the wedding.  Even so, I still regret it.  "
Shelly Wheeler,"Jill met  Joe Biden while married to a night club owner.  Driving around in her corvette.  A social climber, Joe had the better persona as politician.   Why not add the prestige of doctorate in anything, simply because of the title it gives you.  All about branding Jill baby.  "
Jacques De Coster,PhD in Hypergamy?
Carol Geiger,"True. Whatever her degree, her most important title is 'psychic'--who would have looked at Joe in 1975 and predicted this outcome for him?"
Francis Walker,"Thanks for another great column.  When my brother Mikey was doing postdoctoral research at a neuroscience institute, one of the new junior PhD faculty members insisted on being addressed as ""Doctor"".  Mikey, a confirmed egalitarian, begrudgingly complied but then began to address every one else  on the floor including secretaries, technicians and even well-behaved laboratory rodents in mock hushed tones as Dr. Jane, Dr. Julio or Dr Rat.  Needless to say, with just one exception, this endeared him to co-workers and colleagues alike."
William Wahl,Dr. sounds better to me than 'First Lady'. 
eb mem,How about Acting President until Kamala takes over?
Donald Davison,"I recall former Senator Boxer of CA dressing down a General during a Senate hearing for not calling her ""Senator"" when had several times earlier."
David Schmidt,PHD = Piled High & Dry
Verne Thibodeaux,My father (also an MD) used to say Ph.D= piled higher and deeper.
Roland Camp,"There was an arrogant principal at the junior high school in the system where I taught who insisted that people refer to as Dr.   Although it was somewhat juvenile, I copied and surreptitiously  sent her the sidebar from Mark Skousen's ""The Making of Modern Economics"" that discussed how professors, including Milton Friedman, in the Economics Department at the University of Chicago disdained being called Doctor."
Suneel Mahajan,PhD   Poor hungry doctor!
Evelyn Croft,I have half (a third maybe?) of a master's.  Just call me half master. At your service.
Marc Boswell,"Now that was funny, Evelyn!And thought provoking.....ahem.....:-)"
Jay Janney,is that considered a half mast response?I'll show myself to the door. 
eb mem,"Does my MS in accounting entitle me to be called Master, although I would prefer Miss?"
Judith O'Donnell,"Left pretentiousness-recall that Obama was only a lecturer at U of Chicago although the media often referred to him as a professor.Yes, I'm sure, Moderator.  I pay for my WSJ subscription and am entitled to have my opinion published."
eb mem,"He was an adjunct lecturer.Yes, I do want to post this.  Is the black box suppressing a fact, as they did with the quarantining of facts about the Biden crimes?"
Philip Estes,"With everything going on today - pandemic, markets hanging on by its fingernails hoping for stimulus, a sitting president trying to overturn the election - this is what you write about?  "
Judith O'Donnell,Some leftist levity is needed!
r fortin,"And the toughest question Joe Biden got today was ""When are you going to get the Covid shot.""  With everything going on today caused by Biden et al!"
Briana King,"The author (and all the Trumpy commenters) truly are a sorry lot. The amount of energy you spend getting your panties twisted in a bunch about the so-called ""Leftists"" is laughable. In the words of your ""orange emperor"" -- SAD!"
Anne Hall,"Hi, Briana. Have you met Jasmine? She has 3 comments to her name so far, so you might want to come up with 2 more."
Eric S Ludwig,"According to the Oxford Companion to the English Language, the honorific for a PhD is used **specifically** when they are **teaching**, either in public or private institutions. Otherwise, one **may** append the PhD to the name. If she is not a teacher or professor, she is simply Jill Biden, Ed.D. Which sounds a little overblown to me.Moreover, there are Ed D's and there are PhDs. Doctorates in Education typically teach about. dealing with bureaucracies, staffing, curriculum strategies, and teaching theories. SUBJECT doctorates actually deal with a particular subject; e.g. Mathematics, Geology, Library Science. In my case, it is in Germanic Linguistics. However, since I have never taught in my field outside of grad school, I let it go at my name, pure and simple.  The only place it did me any good was when my kids were attending school in Berlin and they teachers scrupulously addressed me as Herr Doktor Ludwig. That changed the tenor of the meeting all together. Ed. D.? Pffft. "
alison beyer,Great burn!
Christie Hopkins,"When it will really get bad is when they start calling Joe ""Mr. President""."
David Sturtz,I hope you can find a safe place to shelter for the next 4 years. 
ROGER ROTHENBERGER,Is there anything about the Bidens that is true?
Judy Neuwirth,"Yes, they are truly awful. "
teri gidwitz,You must be besides yourself.  Thoughts and prayers.
Kevin Spencer,Those hair plugs are real.
Jim Holmberg,They lied about Joe's business with China.
Steven Chen,"Be it Ph.D, Ed.D, OD or MDThey are all Doctors (not just physicians) an acknowledgement of advanced education in specific fields I welcome Dr. Biden to become our First Lady that more girls will be motivated to pursue academic excellence "
Bert M Steece,"You may not know this, Steven, but an Ed.D actually dismisses I.Q. points.  :)    Additionally there is no dearth of girls pursuing academic excellence.  "
Eric S Ludwig,"So Mr. Chen,  Condoleeza Rice was not enough? Oh. Right. Wrong kind of woman; wrong kind of degree."
Jacques De Coster,"Alas, just wrong politics."
Eric S Ludwig,Mostly.
r fortin,"Steven, aren't you sick of the woman thing?  I'm a woman and I am.  There were more women than men in law school, 40 years ago!  Many women just do want to have families and so do slow down i nteh workforce which is why there may not be as many female CEOs.  Until men start delivering babies (which sickeningly enough is probably not that far off), nothing should change!"
Doug Bohrer,They will identify as men when they deliver their babies.  That will make all the difference.
Jay Janney,I hope they aspire to something more than an Ed.D.  
Allen Rebchook,"What with these recent Supreme Court decisions it's almost starting to look as though Jill Biden may become First Lady.Barring, of course, an executive order invalidating all non-Trump ballots."
eb mem,Jill will actually be acting president until Kamala takes over.
Thomas Warr,"True story:  While motoring along a steep mountain road, I encountered a man unconscious after crashing his bicycle.  His friends had 911 on the cell phone, so I took the line, ""Hi, I'm a doctor.""  ""What kind of doctor.""""Internist.""""Oh.""   Apparently, they were disappointed I wasn't a neurosurgeon..."
Anne Hall,"I was once flying cross country when the captain announced that a passenger was in distress and asked over the intercom for a doctor.Moments later,  for a medical doctor."
G Shiner,"There was a time not too long ago ED's were run by an internist and a general surgeon.  In general, lay people don't understand medical qualifications.  "
Octavio Lima,"I like the discussion about the lowering of the standards in higher education, that is an important debate, but I do not have an opinion on the rest of the article."
Jerome Abernathy,"It is standard practice for a Ph.D. to be addressed as ""Dr."" in an academic setting.  Outside of academia, it is appropriate to use ""Ph.D."" at the end of your name, if you so choose.  Jill Biden has taught for many years, so she is used to being addressed accordingly.  Mr. Epstein is being wrong and petty here."
eb mem,"Since Dr. Jill teaches at a junior college, it would seem appropriate for the media to report on what the federal student loan default rate is at that college compared to ITT Tech, which the Obama/Biden administration put out of business for fraud.  That would be a fun article.  But we will never see it."
Jerome Abernathy,"Do try to stay on topic.  But, since you brought it up, Jill Biden's dissertation, ""Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students' Needs"", is quite topical, if it not?"
John Dumas,"I have an MD degree and could care less if someone calls me ""Mr.""That's not where my feelings of self-worth derive."
Judy Neuwirth,"In England, surgeons are usually referred to as ""Mister"" while non-surgeons are ""Doctor"". But here, ""Doctor"" usually means ""medical doctor."" So Jill should stop her embarrassing insistence on being called ""Doctor"", which resulted in the odd circumstance where she referred to HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, a genuine neurosurgeon, as ""Mr. Carson"" and herself as ""Dr. Biden"" "
Francis Ledwidge,"Women surgeons in England generally prefer the title ""Miss"" !"
Jim Holmberg,"I have an MD degree and could care less if someone calls me ""Mr.""
That's not where my feelings of self-worth derive.From my observation, that tends to be the case with people who have acrually earned a doctorate.As an aside, in continental Europe, esp. Germany, lawyers are addressed as ""Dr."""
Terry Gawryk,"       Germans, Austrians, and Mittle-europeans have a long cultural history of pronoun mania.       Not unusual to find:  Professor-Doktor, Ing. all before the name.  And I've seen more than a few: ""Dr. Dr""'s.          Our American-participatory culture on the Left has become enamored with ""Doctor"" even when it's an honorary degree.  Utter shameless fatuousness."
David Corban,"My God, how threatened some of the non-doctors appear to be.  Whoof, go back to school, fellas."
mike monday,"""""Dr. Dr""'   Sounds like a line out of Young Frankenstein.  :)"
mike monday,"Hey Davy,""how threatened some of the non-doctors appear to be""]I have a MS and  6 patents.  Please refer to me as 'Scientist' Mike.BTW, my son is law, a doctor at UCSF is...'Will'."
TYLER KNIGHT,"I don't see anywhere in the opinion piece where he claims Jill is offended at someone calling her 'Ms.', or that she derives her self-worth from honorifics, as you claim. Unless you are harboring information not yet public, I'm not sure where you got that notion. It's pretty typical to append one's degrees to titles in a professional setting, so if that is the qualm the author has, it's rather watery. If you feel strongly about his stance though, you could white out the MD on your diploma and replace it with Mr. "
Jerome Abernathy,"Shove that, Mr. Epstein.  In academic circles, it is appropriate to address a Ph.D. as Dr.  That title predates its use for medical doctors.  Outside of academia, it is totally appropriate to use Ph.D. at the end of your name.  It's not vain or pretentious, it's earned."
Tom Kozas,What a steaming mound of piled higher and deeper.
tim harris,"Seriously?A  Ph.D  expecting to be addressed ""doctor"" is appropriate in the BioSciences,  OK, in ancient  history, and in all other cases, especially  sociology, english, and ""studies,"" is laughable.    Lawyers in particular,  delight in  humorously puncturing the pretentiousnes  of any hostile expert foolish enough  to refer to himself or herself as  ""Doctor.""   Its so fun: ""Now 'doctor X,'-- incidentally, you're not a medical doctor are you?""  ""No, I'm not,"" they say sometimes huffily.. ""But i have a Ph. D.""""Ah, a Ph. D.   Well,  just so we all understand, you  aren't licnesed to prescribe narcotics,  or operate on anyone are you? You don't work in a hospital?""Each time is a treat.       "
Jay Janney,"Except she didn't earn an Ph.D.She has an Ed.D.  In my field, that isn't a sufficient degree to be considered a scholarly academic for accreditation purposes. "
Jerome Abernathy,In education it most certainly is.
eb mem,That's only because education has such low standards.
Jerome Abernathy,"""That's only because education has such low standards.""So says you.  Whatever your field may be, you didn't learn what ""non sequitur"" means."
Michael Welch,"Years ago I was fishing with a man who had a doctorate in Library Science. He had that kind of scholarly look. As we were walking along the shore line we came upon a man who was in some sort of distress. The man looked at my friend and said: Are you a Doctor?My friend replied:  I am, but not the kind that you need.;-)"
Bill Culver,NA
David Schmidt,"I'm an MD so it's ok to call me doctor. However, I must admit I can only remember one delivery during my med school days when the baby slipped out of my hands and I nearly dropped the infant on the L&D floor (before I stopped the descent on my recovery grasp). But I digress. Jill, lose the ""Dr."" especially during COVID because no one outside the medical profession deserves that title. "
Jerome Abernathy,"""But I digress. Jill, lose the ""Dr."" especially during COVID because no one outside the medical profession deserves that title.""Huh?  The use of Dr. in academia predates its use for medical doctors.  It is standard practice."
ROGER ROTHENBERGER,"So what if use of ""Dr"" predates use in the medical field. The proliferation, and reduced standards for earning, merit a lot less respect for the kind of nonsense we are getting out of academia. Also using Dr for medical only means you don't have to remember their names."
Jerome Abernathy,"""The proliferation, and reduced standards for earning, merit a lot less respect for the kind of nonsense we are getting out of academia.""If not for academia, you wouldn't be posting here."
Andy Cunningham,Did you read the article?  Carefully?
RICHARD GREEN,Well said!  Thank you.
Bill Straw,This is a very old controversy. Some people just have a need to impress others.
Alan kelman,Given their generally horrific performances of late our educators need all the emotional support they can muster. 
Margaret Snyder,"Doing so earlier might have saved Whoopi Goldberg the embarrassment of suggesting Jill Biden for Surgeon General, remarking, ""She's a heck of a doctor."""
Janice Kemker,"I believe that this is the exact quote from Whoopi:  ""I'm hoping Dr. Jill becomes the surgeon general ... she's a hell of a doctor. She's an amazing doctor,"" Goldberg said, as if she knew of the former second lady's medical expertise.  Hmmm, strange how this comment was not parodied on SNL."
Janice Kemker,"Exact quote: ""I'm hoping Dr. Jill becomes the surgeon general ... she's a hell of a doctor. She's an amazing doctor,"" Goldberg said, as if she knew of the former second lady's medical expertise.  "
Janice Kemker,Whoopi was recommending her for Surgeon General as she is such a fine doctor. WHOOPS. Never mind.
Janice Kemker,"Have been trying to add verbal insight,  think this one made the muster."
Janice Kemker,It is like playing a word game were the rules were never set but always change.
Judy Neuwirth,Just like the election in many states. And to think they're still magically discovering ballots in upstate New York every time it looks like the Republican will win the House seat...
Richard Palmer,"Jill, read the book #Deleted by Bokhari. Censorship on a large scale occurs at Google and social media providers and it has come to the WSJ.Yes, the ""educated"" shall guide our communications and spoon feed us as to what we shall consume in public discourses.   What are the backgrounds of the censors and those writing the AI codes to catch the miscreants and their references to bad websites? Just as with govt. regs, once imposed, the reach of oversight expands.Can't refer to web sites without being subject to their ""objective"", truth-determining oversight. I referred to the BLS web site and had to have the reference checked.I copy over comments to Word before I hit post, just in case I have violated the current guidelines of the truth overseers."
John Sevic,"Education Dr. is an oxy_m_oron, just like intelligent liberal. "
ERIC SCHINDLER,"If she has earned her degree, she is entitled to the title. It is a matter of choice. I use mine variably as the situation dictates. It is something I've earned and choose.  It's called freedom."
Dean Hinnen,I certainly hope your degree is in a more valid discipline than education.
Nancy Kilbourn,An advanced degree in education is something of a joke. Education departments are now so politically correct that there is no attempt at any study that might assist students in learning.  
Wayne Grabow,"We have an acquaintance who has a PhD in education.  Interestingly, every time we get a letter from this person it includes misspellings and poor grammar.  Nice person, but not doctorate level."
TYLER KNIGHT,"You should contact their alma mater and inform the administration that although you believe they are nice, you have decided to revoke their degree."
Eddie Bustamante,"How does she spell ""Covfefe""?"
Eugene Gelhaar,Funny.When I was a student at Northwestern (1949ff) somebody called one of my profs doctor and he made precisely Mr. Epstein's point: it was assumed that anybody teaching there had his Ph.D..  
Amanda W,Hey!  I delivered some babies!  Just call me Dr.  Mom.Chris Whitelonis 
Bob Acker,"Funny.  ""Fraudulent, even comic""  is just how I feel about ""President"" Trump.  What a joke that is."
John Sevic,"Keep pressing D, it's easier than thinking. "
Ray Perry,She might also want to avoid calling herself the stepmother of Hunter.
Jim Holmberg,Why?  It's one of her greatest accomplishments.He does have a doctorate (J. D.) from Yale!
TYLER KNIGHT,And Kavanagh has a B.A. (Brewski Aficionado) from Yale as well. Yale will dole out degrees for anything.
Jim Holmberg,"Except Kavanaugh has actually earned an honest living with his J. D.Post it, my little Red Guard.  Nothing here violates your ""community standards."""
Jim Holmberg,"Except Kavanaugh has actually earned an honest living with his J. D.

Brewski Aficionando?  Are you aware that Hunter was chaptered out of the Navy one month after receiving his Daddy-bought commission for cocaine abuse?"
Eddie Bustamante,"That's rich making fun of an American for drug use. Hunter, sadly, finds many compatriots sharing his issues with drugs as we are the largest consumer nation of illegal and legal drugs in the world. "
JIM SHULER,Jill Biden wanted this presidency worse that Joe did.   She shamelessly and relentlessly   pushed a man that is clearly in cognitive decline and then has led the charge to protect him from scrutiny by the press.This is not going to end well for the Biden family and it is not going to end well for this country.   A stolen election is no badge of honor for the Biden family and that Dr moniker will be the least of their worries.
Judy Neuwirth,She knew that the family's only chance of avoiding prison was running Joe from the basement.
Gary Jarmin,"...so  he can pardon Hunter, then his brother and, finally, himself while a groveling media will twist itself into a pretzel justifying this presidential malpractice. "
Richard Krauland,"""...had paid $70,000 a year for their university education, or perhaps I should say for their ""credential.""  Exactly!I've been saying for years that a college degree in 2020 is better described as a ""certificate of indoctrination"".    Students are taught more about systemic racism, bogus climate science, and socialism; than they are about math, science, reading, writing, or engineering.  No wonder Democrats want to give them away for free.And ""As for your Ed.D., Madame First Lady"",  she hasn't earned that ""First Lady"" title yet either."
Jerome Abernathy,"""She shamelessly and relentlessly""Really?  When did you first meet her?  How long have you two known each other?"
Jim Holmberg,"Can I say the same about you and Trump, Jer?"
Jerome Abernathy,"I don't claim to know anything about what motivates Trump, but I can observe that he's incompetent, and that he doesn't promote, embody, or enforce American values."
Jim Holmberg,Really?Compare Trump's economy to BO's.  Or his Mideast successes to BO's abject failures.
TYLER KNIGHT,"Irrelevant. How are those even comparing remotely related matters. Why did you even bring up the president as a comparison to first lady-elect. To challenge the observation that an impersonal characterization of the first lady is probably baseless, you invoke an outside figure presumably to point to your irritation that the baselessness was highlighted in the first place, as opposed to addressing it directly. You clearly lower the quality of discussion in this thread."
Peter Kranzler,Nobody stole the election and Biden is not in cognitive decline. I can tell that the next four years will be very difficult for you. 
Tig Krekel,Seriously?  When was the last time you listened to Joe talk without the help of a teleprompter?  I do not take any delight in pointing out his obvious decline and I have had one-on-one contact with him in the past and readily see the vast difference.  Makes me very sad.
TYLER KNIGHT,"Trump doesn't use a teleprompter because he has an undiagnosed learning disability and reading out loud is difficult for him. Given that, and for other obvious reasons, I'm not sure teleprompter use is a reliable clinical predictor of decline."
Candace C,"Obviously you have not watched his 90 minute long rally speeches. You may not like Trump but he is very sharp, and a great presenter.  "
Jim Holmberg,"But the Dems tried in 2016.  With what they thought was the collusion of ""Russian intelligence sources.""Use the WSJ search function for ""Danchenko"", Pete."
Jim Anderson,"Keep repeating those stock phrases.  Eventually, you may even convince yourself that they are true!"
Marc Yland,Real Dr's go to work.
DAVID GROSS,But she worked hard at getting Joe into the West Wing rather than an Assisted Living Wing.
Georgia Androutsopoulou,"Hear, hear. Second that. GA's husband, M.D."
John Dumas,Perfectly stated.  Been saying this for years.  Try calling a lawyer (JD) to deliver your baby.  It'll cost too much!
DAVID GROSS,By the time you'd finish signing the release forms the baby would be an adult.
Thomas Fannin,"thank you, Mr. Epstein for writing this out loud! A  doctorate was a goal of mine in the 80s until I realized I was so much better off financially, i.e., not paying tuition, and, financially in that experience along with hutzpah raised my income levels. "
Diane Richter,"She is not a Doctor or Ph.D. The EDD is micky mouse degree without rigor backing it up. I have a doctorate from UC Berkeley (in Biological Anthropology circa 1980, with much scholastic effort). It is general knowledge at UCB, and beyond, most EDDS are poorly trained in almost anything approaching rigorous science."
